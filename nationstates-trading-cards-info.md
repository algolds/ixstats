Trading cards? What's that?

The Northern Light wrote:
Trading cards are NationStates' own trading card game. You can generate, trade, and collect cards representing other nations, with each card having its own rarity and value. There is a whole dedicated market where you can buy or sell cards, and compete to rise through the rankings for most valuable decks, as well as increase the value of your nation's own card. Or, you can simply create your own themed collections, e.g., your friends, enemies, regionmates, best flags, and anything else you can think of!


Why should I start trading?

Given that players from many regions (including The North Pacific, The West Pacific, The East Pacific, The Pacific, The Rejected Realms, 10000 Islands, and Texas, to name a few) have actively been involved with cards, deciding to get involved with this field will open players to an entirely new community to explore! (And yes, even game administrators, issues editors, and moderators are heavily active.) Of course, not just the wide-ranging community is to take note of, but you're also entitled to making a name for yourself, whether by collecting the most cards of a specific theme, achieving one of the most valuable decks to ever grace the leaderboard, possessing the most bank out of any player, or by becoming a philanthropist whom continues to serve as an example of pure generosity (people have actually done this in the past)!

Whoa. Sounds cool! But how do I start?

Each player has a (roughly) 20% chance to obtain a card pack from answering an issue. Answering these daily will reward you several packs, and the maximum you may store per nation is 9. You will know if you won a card pack by scrolling to the bottom of the screen right after answering an issue, as seen here:

Click to show...
... or by answering all your issues, going back to your nation's main page, and clicking on the card logo:

Click to show...
... in order to check whether you've won any packs! Each pack contains 5 cards, and some might already have bids placed on them. If you wish to quickly gain some cash, sell the card to that bidder, especially if said bid happens to be over junk value!

Junking is the act of trashing your card (done by clicking on the card and pressing "junk"; note that cards from rare rarity and upwards will require confirmation before junking) in order to accumulate a set number of "junked bank". This varies by rarity, with commons yielding a junk value of 0.01 bank, uncommons a value of 0.05 bank, and so forth. Players typically do this in order to quickly generate bank (since selling a card at auction takes a minimum 1 hour) and instantly pay for a card. Do this if you're short on time!

Of course, sometimes you won't immediately get a card you want. If you're caught in this situation, you are able to do the following: A) lodge a standing bid with the bank you have and wait for someone to notice, B) telegramming an owner of that card, or C) by posting on the card forum to have people quickly check whether they can sell a copy!

Once you gain a card (whether from buying or simply opening packs), assuming you wish to actually keep the card (and not junk/sell it), you can then A) start a collection (done by clicking "Create a collection" at your nation's card page and adding cards to said collection) and/or B) view the cards you have in your deck, and you may even use deck filter buttons to narrow down the list of cards you possess in case you want to view specific ones!

For Example, a Deck Filter Button's Being Used to Only Show Someone's Epic Cards
Finally, it's important to know that all nations possess an official deck limit for how many cards each nation may store. Once you reach said limit, you must consume a certain amount of bank in order to expand your current capacity, otherwise gifting becomes unavailable and your nation will be restrained from opening further packs (though you may still purchase more cards from auctions).

Expanding your capacity increases by the squared exponent of every whole number (i.e. 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.), and purchasing the Site Supporter badge from the store grants you double the permitted capacity (along with doubling the capacity you gain each time your limit's expanded).

To give you an idea, here is a table of the expansion costs for (both) regular users and Site Supporters (brought to you by Valentine Z):

The list goes on, naturally. Don't think that this is the maximum number of cards you can store!

Any particular tools to help me trade?

Yes, actually! There are several useful player-created features to utilize at your convenience:

1. List of Cards in XML - Created by active code junkie and trader Ballotonia, this downloadable file contains an index for every single card in the game! In total, there are an estimated 180000 cards (per season), so use this list if you are aiming for a massive collection! [Note: it is highly advised that you download a text editor such as Sublime in order to better read this file.]
2. Card Queries Page - Created by (another) code junkie + trader 1 very fast endotarter, this tool allows players to look up cards of a particular type, including card rarity, badge type, government type, and more. Use this if you don't feel like manually searching for what you need!

3. Card Market Watch - Another creation by 1 very fast endotarter, this document serves to actively track the statistical data regarding the entire card market, including auction activity, every legendary's combined market value, the total amount of cards currently pullable, and just how generous the gifting has gotten; all of these are noted daily and recorded up to its date of creation (i.e. July 7, 2019).

4. LinkGoldretriever-Web - Created by Java enthusiast Racoda (and inspired from the original version by Valentine Z), this open source application will (automatically) output the total amount of bank + deck value (along with, should you input the password for each nation, the number of unanswered issues and unopened packs) for each nation listed! As to how it's done, 1) go to the website, 2) input the name of your nation(s) (if you have multiple accounts, press the "Enter" key each time you list a nation's name to add new lines), and 3) press "Start". [Note: if you wish to also calculate the number of unanswered issues + unopened packs per nation, you must ensure that the mode is set to "Auto" to enable the feature and then list both the nation's name & password and separate the two with a comma.]

5. NationStates Card Management Queue - Created by long-time user Anozia (and later expanded upon by traders Destructive Government Economic System and Racoda), this script utilizes the Tampermonkey extension (instructions on how to use the script + extension being found here) in order to allow many features, including 1) the saving of specific (or all, when using the Card Queries tool) cards to a queue for selling/gifting when needed, 2) the addition of a cards icon at the top of your nation's page (clicking on the icon will conveniently redirect you towards the deck page), and 3) the removal of the nation-name from Season 2 cards (when the lower half of the card is clicked) to allow full access to the flag appearance of the cards! [Note: the script version that you must use to access these features is within this post, as provided by Evrigenis.]

6. Firefox Containers - This guide - written by code expert Racoda - goes over an extension specifically made for the Mozilla Firefox browser, with said extension allowing you to trade/farm cards on multiple tabs simultaneously! Racoda's guide may take a while to understand, but it will definitely prove to be one of the most beneficial tools if you plan on utilizing multiple nations for card purposes!

Final thing, please note that using a script that automatically performs card-based actions (including answering issues to obtain card packs, placing bids/asks, or junking cards) has been ruled illegal, per Eluvatar's and [violet]'s respective announcements, so if you plan on developing any of these tools... you'll probably realize that none of the players will actually use them. Other than that, have fun with coding!

What are auctions?

Auctions are the primary way to win a card for your collection, with each auction starting when: A) a nation places a bid that matches/goes over the minimum asking price or B) a nation lodges an ask that matches/goes below the highest bid at the time. Each auction lasts for a minimum 1 hour, and said auctions will extend by one minute each time a nation overbids the highest bidder or undercuts the lowest ask.

During auctions, the card (that got matched) will be displayed in an active list of auctions, and you may narrow down the list of auctions to find your desired auction by using the auction filter buttons. These filter buttons will eliminate auctions that do not meet your criteria for what card(s) you're wishing to track (such as the card that's being auctioned not being of a certain rarity or season), as seen from the following:

See This Jumble of Auctions?
I Only Want to See Legendaries! Get Rid of the Rest!
I Don't Like Other Seasons' Cards! I Just Want to Track Those from Season 1!
(As displayed above, you may only have one filter button active at a time; "multi-filtering" will be added in a later update.)

After an auction ends, the nation that bought/sold the card will receive a notification of that card being bought/sold, and the nation that sold the card will be prohibited from re-selling that card for 3 minutes, after which the card will be permitted to be re-sold by that nation.

[Side Note: The minimum bid/ask a nation may lodge is 0.01, while the maximum is 10000.]

What types of people participate in auctions?

When involving yourself in auctions, you'll notice that players have different methods as to how they win cards from others! These players are (roughly) classified into one of the 3 types:

1. Regular Bidders - Regular bidders are players (typically with a high quantity of bank) who decide to bid an amount that would be deemed significantly more profitable (for the person selling the card) than the previous lodged bid. These players primarily bid significant amounts to discourage other players from bidding in an auction (otherwise they may end up losing more bank than wanted).
Example of Regular Bidding
2. Penny Bidders - Penny bidders are players (typically with a low quantity of bank) who decide to outbid the previously highest bidder by an extremely low amount (such as 0.01 bank). Penny bidding is typically done in order to save bank, and this strategy primarily works with cards of a lower value/rarity (such as a common).

Example of Penny Bidding
3. Snipers - Snipers are sneaky players who decide to outbid the original player by any amount of bank at the very last second. This gives the original bidder only 1 minute to re-outbid the player (since outbidding will always increase the auction timer by 1 minute), giving the sniper a tactical advantage in earning cards without significant competition.

A Sniper in Action
Only a Minute Left
How can I ensure my card gets bought?

Since each auction takes a minimum 1+ hours to complete, you will very-likely be outbid on one of the things you're buying (especially if the card you're bidding on is desired by many players). If that occurs, re-lodge a bid of a significantly higher quantity in order to discourage them from continuing their outbidding spree any further.

It is also noteworthy that some sneaky players (i.e. snipers) might attempt to outbid you at the very last second (and win the card), leaving only a minute for you to counter their bid. Due to this, you are advised to: A) watch the auction for its entire duration or B) watch it during the last 5 minutes to ensure no last-minute bidders will make an attempt to snipe your card.

But what if I don't want to use auctions to buy cards?

At the moment, the are currently 2 ways for players to make use of the auctions system without the intention to purchase cards:

1. Bank Transfers - Bank transfers are the act of deliberately selling a card your main nation has to a puppet for an unusually high price. Nations typically conduct bank transfers in order to accumulate a large amount of bank that is representative from all of their nations (rather than just their main), allowing them to pay for additional or more expensive cards that would've been thought unthinkable for single-nation players.
What Transfers Can Look Like
2. Bank Heists - Of course, bank transfers have a downside. When you publicly sell a card to your puppet for a high price, at least one player will be tempted to underask your price, stealing said puppet's bank that was intended to go to your main. This defines a bank heist, and if an active player already possesses the card you were using as a transfer medium, said player will very-likely underask you in order to gain an unexpected increase in bank.
.

What is gifting?

Gifting, as the title may suggest, is the act of directly sending over a card you have in your deck to another nation at no cost for the recipient. Gifting each card will cost the junk value of said card, and you will be unable to gift cards unless you already possess the required amount of bank.

Each card has its own junk value, but this differs per rarity, right?

Of course! As you might've noted in the main page, the junk value of each card differs by rarity, with a list of all current junk values being provided:

Rarity of Card

Junk Value

Legendary

1.00

Epic

0.50

Ultra-Rare

0.20

Rare

0.10

Uncommon

0.05

Common

0.01

You probably could've guessed, but gifting cards can prove to be quite expensive, especially if they are valuable ones such as legendaries, so it is advisable that you primarily gift cards that people will actually enjoy (whether due to the card's high market value or personal worth).

How do I access the gifting feature?

You may access the option to gift cards by clicking on the card. Doing so will prompt you to either "junk" said card or "gift" it to a certain user. Click "gift", and you will be directed towards a blank space for you to type the name of the nation you wish to send the card to (along with the gifting fee to actually send it):

Click to show...
[Note: Since there is no actual trade going on between the two nations, gifting will always be recorded in a card's trade history as a blank hyphen, like so:]

Click to show...
Why do people gift cards?

Generosity, of course! Gifting well sought-after cards to those who want it will leave a good impression on those players, and (in return) they will very-likely assist you in building your dream deck as a token of appreciation!

You also could probably bribe users with free cards, but some might not budge...

What if I want to gift cards to myself?

Well... if you mean it like this...

Click to show...
... then yes, you can gift cards to yourself using the exact same nation (and for free, OMG!).

Other than that, you can also have one of your alternate/"puppet" nations gift a card it pulled/purchased to your main account. Players do this in order to bypass the auction system (since it takes quite a while and comes at the risk of the card being stolen by bidders) and quickly have the card sent over to their primary collecting nation. The benefits of doing so include: A) guaranteeing the success of amassing bank in your main since there are no bank heists in gifting and B) easily increasing your deck value since nobody is there to steal the valuable card you wanted.
Now that you know about the basics of NationStates cards, we'll start taking a look at more-advanced tips for those who wish to take their understanding to the next level! This page will serve as a repository of interesting ways for you to further your experience in trading, with topics from all card-based areas being covered:

Can I obtain a card without the use of bank?

In a way, yes, you can! Certain players will not be so willing to offer one of their prized cards in exchange for money. Should you encounter such players, you can instead offer to gift them a card in exchange for them doing the same for the card you asked for (as a form of trade rather than a purchase). Naturally, it is advised to offer a card of equal/similar value to the owner of the card you want (unless you can offer a card of personal worth, which will likely require you to know the player more).

For example: say that a player wishes to purchase the much-desired Testlandia, but can't seem to get any of the owners to sell it, so that player decides to gift a Queen Yuno in exchange for Testlandia being gifted (in return). Both cards are immensely popular, so this trade is almost guaranteed to work! And with this in mind, now you've got another method in order to earn your desired item.

Whoa. I can gift cards to obtain cards, but how do I let people know?

As you might've heard in the main page, it is possible to let people know of what you're offering by either telegramming them or posting on the cards forum.

The former is more suited to quickly garner a response from the owners of your card. However, you will need to make sure that your telegram is well-worded and not intended to sound condescending. Otherwise, people might ignore your telegram and maybe even block you out of annoyance, so make sure you leave a good impression on them!

Here's an Example of an Ideal Telegram
The latter is more suited to allow everyone who uses said forum to notice your offer and check whether they own the card you want. However, you will have to note of the fact that not everyone (who has the card) actually uses the forum either (especially since the cards form is relatively new), so you might be forced to wait a bit in order for an interested player to respond.

I'm trying to search for a specific card. Is there a way to do that?

Absolutely, and here are the methods to do so:

1. For players that are currently active, you may search their names on the dossier. If active, their nation's main page should then be accessible. After opening said page, click the displayed Linkcard logo, and it will take you to the nation's card page. You will then be able to click "View card: [NATION NAME]" at the top right-hand corner!
Here's an Example
2. For nations that have ceased-to-exist (CTE), this is also possible!. As per Frisbeeteria's announcement, it is currently possible to search up the card for any inactive nation.

You do this by going to the boneyard and typing in the name of the nation. The resulting nation should have a link(s) to any card that have been made for them. If cards have been made for that nation, then all you need to do is simply click on the image of the card to be directed towards the page for the card you searched for!

[Note: some nations, due to being founded/re-founded after the time a season was introduced, will not have a card, so the dossier and boneyard search methods will only work if nations actually have a card printed for them.]

That specific card happens to be extremely rare, and I want it for my collection! How do I obtain it?

Some cards may prove to be rather difficult to obtain. This may be the case for multiple reasons, whether it be due to 1) a lack of owners, 2) unwillingness of owners to sell the card due to said card's popularity, 3) all the owners are inactive/not interested in trading cards, or 4) the nation behind the card has ceased-to-exist (CTE'd). Whatever it may be, there are two ways as to how you may acquire a hard-to-obtain card:

1. Directly Telegramming One of the Owners - As mentioned above (see "Whoa. I can gift cards to obtain cards, but how do I let people know?"), you will always have a greater chance to obtain cards (even the rarest cards in the game!) by simply telegramming the owners. If you're lucky, one of those owners may log in, read your telegram, and honor your willingness to directly message them by selling you the card!

(And of course, writing a nicely-worded telegram makes the chances for them to sell even higher!)

2. Pinging All of the Owners in a Dispatch - If you are not interested in sending each owner a telegram, then simply list the owners (of a card you want) in a dispatch and state (in the dispatch) that each one of them owns the card you are looking for! [Note: this may be a more annoying method to get the attention of card owners, so do this sparingly in order to not be seen as a spammer.]

How can I increase the amount of bank and cards I wish to obtain (without actually trading with other players)?

Making additional nations (known as "puppets") is currently the suggested method to gather additional cards and cash, since more nations = more issues to answer for packs, with those packs yielding cards to keep, junk, or sell! Creating a minimum of 10 additional nations allows you to quickly purchase most cards within the market, while going to 30 can swiftly aid your rise to the top in the deck value leaderboard!

I'm trying to clean my deck, but some cards I wish to still keep. How do I ensure they're kept safe?

Once you're at the point where you have too many cards, you might start junking them to free up deck space. To prevent accidental junking, lodge an ask of 10000 for the card you wish to keep. Lodging this huge ask will both A) prevent you from junking the card unless you remove said ask and B) prevent players from buying your card, since paying 10000 bank for one is simply ludicrous!

Click to show...
How do I keep track of the cards I want to buy?

Lodge a bid of 0.01 bank. These cards, should they be put on auction, will always appear in your auction list, even if you're not the highest bidder! Do this if you're interested in buying a particular card but don't want to commit all your bank due to the uncertainty of the card actually being worth the payment.

Click to show...
(They will also appear in your auction list if you ask a card for 10000 as well.)

If I have bids in place, how can I find the total bank I have left?

Once you have a bid lodged, the total amount of bank you may utilize in future auctions will decrease (unless you remove those bids). To find out how much you have left, go to your nation's trade page, click on "bids", and scroll to the very bottom of the page. The amount you have placed in bids should appear, and you can then subtract that value from your total bank to determine how much you have left.

Here's an Example
What measures can I take to purchase a card without consuming too much bank?

1. If another player is currently bidding on a card you want (or has overbid a card that you were bidding on), pretend that you have not noticed anything for the majority of the auction. Then at the last few seconds of the auction, bid over them. This allows you to win over your card without having the other bidder detect you (and only really fails if the other player likes to watch their auctions all the time). Bidding for a card at the last second (and winning it) is what referred to as sniping, since you'll be hidden from counter bids most of the time!
2. When countering another bidder, be careful to not bid too much. If you bid too much, the other player (should they already have a copy of the card you own) might lodge an ask that matches the overwhelmingly high amount of bank you bid and bid that same amount of bank for the less-priced copy you two were competing over (earning an overall net profit while still keeping their copy of the card). This is what constitutes dropping, and if you fall victim to an unexpectedly lodged (and expensive) ask by the other player then you are considered to have been "dropped".

In This Case, the Bidder at the Very Bottom Got Dropped
How can I ensure the safety of my bank transfers?

A rule of thumb in bank transfers is that if someone tries asking for an incredibly low price (such as 0.01), simply lodge a bid at that price, forcing the person who attempted to heist your bank to make only that much profit and ensuring the completion of your transfer.

Also, be sure to only use either: A) low-owner cards to conduct your transfers (since more owners means more players who will try to heist your transfer) or B) a ton of copies of a particular card (since you can commit a small portion of bank to each copy, mitigating the damage if a heist is attempted).

Next, note that (as mentioned in the Auction Page), even if you choose to conduct a transfer with a low-owner card, that other players always have a chance (though it is very low) to pull it from a pack, so if someone actually pulls your low-owner card then they now have the ability to heist your transfer.

Finally, should someone attempt to heist you, underask their offer to once again match to your puppet's bid, and it is highly advised to do so at the very last moments of the auction to avoid detection.

With these 4 things in mind, here are some ways as to how you may conduct a safe transfer:


1. For newer players with few cards, it is best if you transfer a relatively sizeable amount of bank (perhaps 1-3 bank) on a low-owner card (preferably with less than 15 owners).
[Note: If you are unable to find a low-owner card, then check each owner as to see whether they are an active nation (i.e. if they have logged in during the last 5 days). If they are not, then you are ensured of them not heisting you, and you can subtract them from the owner count (since they won't be online at the time of your transfer).]

What a Basic Transfer Looks Like
2. To take the basic transfer a step further, you can use a low-owner card to sneak in a massive transfer at the very last second! [Note: you will need 2 copies of said low-owner card to actually work.] During the majority time of the auction, ask for junk price on the 1st copy of the card you're using to transfer. Let the auction run, then at the last few seconds of the auction, transfer the large amount of bank (it can be any amount, even hundreds!) with the other copy of the transfer card you had. This gives people only a minute (at most) to notice the large offer and attempt to steal your bank, so this is almost guaranteed to work!

What a Sneaky Transfer Looks Like
3. Finally, you may consider a completely different method of transferring bank. As mentioned earlier, continuously buy an unthinkable number of copies (of one card) and sell each copy at a fixed price (maximum of 3 bank) to your puppet nation(s). That way, if someone underasks you then you will lose only a small portion of the bank you were transferring to your main! (Plus, if someone underasks then you can simply buy their copy and add yet another copy to your transfer card stash.)
How long does each season (of NationStates cards) last?

As you may already know, it is currently Season 2 of trading cards, and that each season lasts for a limited amount of time. As to when ongoing seasons end, nobody knows (well, nobody except [violet], i.e. the head administrator). Therefore, it is advised to work on your collection as much as possible, for the next season might appear just around the corner! [Note: there is a possibility that seasons last for an estimated year, though.]

Once a new season is introduced, nations currently alive/not CTE will have their respective cards made for them, with the format of each card varying per season.

Once a new season starts, can I still obtain packs from previous seasons?

Yes, actually! The chance is extraordinarily low (approximately 1%), but you may occasionally: A) draw packs of a previous season during its subsequent card season or B) open a current season's pack that'll be a combination of cards featured from this season and of previous ones (though the latter only occurs when a previous season's card is already being auctioned). This potentially allows you to gain immensely rare + valuable cards that players during current seasons might strive to trade for, so if you ever generate an older season's card pack, make an attempt to save all of those cards. They're probably worth something!

What determines the rarity of my card?

A wide range of factors are involved, but the primary way that determine's everyone's rarity is their A) influence and B) stat badge rankings.

Influence is earned by joining the World Assembly + receiving endorsements and/or continuously residing in a region. A player's influence will increase at a faster rate depending on the number of endorsements they receive, and their rarity will subsequently have a higher chance at upgrading during the next season.

NationStates stat badges are earned by answering issues, and if they're answered in a way that targets a specific stat then a player can increase their place in the World Census leaderboard. Relatively unheard-of users, as a result, have managed to become cards of a higher rarity due to their notable amount of high-ranking badges.

As an Example, See This Legendary Card?
THIS is Why They're a Legendary Card!
Deck value, if you don't know already, is the cumulative value of all the cards your nation owns, and each card's value may increase if players purchase it enough times (thereby increasing its market value to over its junk value). Collecting additional cards (particularly ones with a high market value) will result in your nation's deck value increasing, thereby boosting the chance to heighten your card's rarity in the next season!

[Note: deck value has only been Linkrecently added as a deciding factor, so it will only start impacting rarities once Season 3 begins.]

...

If you wish to see the other factors that may determine rarity, see this list. Just know that they are less impactful or harder to obtain for normal players:

Click to show...
I don't like the appearance of my card! Is there any way for me to change it?

Though this is a very time-specific method, yes, there is a way! Right before a new season officially starts (as in, cards for that season become pullable from packs), all nations that have cards made for them are allowed to utilize a feature called the inscription feature.

Inscription is a tool that allows users to update the current appearance of their card(s). To be more accurate, if you choose to do any of the following during this several-day period: 1) update your nation's flag, name, classification, motto, demonyms, leader, national religion, currency, or capital city in the settings, 2) change any of your World Census statistics badges (which can be done via several methods such as answering issues), 3) obtain special/non-World Census badges such as Easter eggs, authors' badges, regional founder, et cetera, or 4) allow your population to increase a bit further - then those changes should then be updated into your card should you utilize the inscription feature.

[Note: the inscription tool does have limits. Once your card's made, you are unable to use the tool to alter the card's rarity (along with the corresponding rarity color) or region name.]

To access inscription, you must first be sure that a news announcement is in place that tells you of the feature's availability (it's only available several days before a season begins). If the announcement indicates that the feature's still available, you can then access the tool by: 1) going to your deck page, 2) viewing your card (done by clicking "View card: [NATION NAME]" at the top right-hand corner), and 3) clicking on the inscription button, which should be right above your new/soon-to-be card!

After the inscription period of several days is over, the season will then officially begin, therefore ending the ability for traders to utilize the aforementioned feature as a result (and this is the only known method for nations to alter the appearance of their card, save for removing rule-breaking content via a Getting Help Request).

Are there official ways for people to recognize my collection?

There is one way. Players may choose to share their collections in this pinned forum topic, which currently serves as a reference for the largest and most unique decks out of the entire card community. Being rather selective as to which actually get featured, it is well-advised for players to work hard if they wish to have one of their collections listed!

Other than this, there seem to be no other official methods (at the moment).

Are there any active card communities I can be a part of?

Definitely! This varies by region, with some of the largest regions (including The North Pacific, the Pacific, and The Rejected Realms) having fully-fledged card programs for the benefit of all players. For more information regarding regional card communities, ask one of their officers!

Outside regions, there is also one (semi-official) discord server for trading cards, with many of the greatest traders (such as Frisbeeteria, Xoriet, and Mikeswill, to name a few) being active members. If you wish to gain tips from more-advanced players, then this server might be suited for you!

(Also, while we're mentioning Discord, you should consider adding this bot, created by code master Darcania, to any servers you own. It allows you to locate the card info and/or deck details for any nation at the type of a single command!)

I think something weird is going on, and it's not because of me. How can I get this fixed?

On very rare occasions, players may sometimes experience unusual bugs in the trading system (such as an auction not starting like it's supposed to). Should you witness one of these unusual occurrences, post in the Technical forum and wait for an administrator to respond. The bug should then be fixed.

Also, if you have any new ideas to propose for trading cards, feel free to post in this forum as well!

How do I earn cards?
Each time you answer an issue, you have a chance of receiving a new pack. Each pack contains five randomly chosen cards.

What do I do with them?
Cards are cosmetic. They grant no benefits other than the warm fuzzy feeling of owning them.

How do I trade them?
You can:

Junk a card by exchanging it for a small amount of bank. Click the flag area of the card to reveal the "Junk" button.

Gift a card to another nation by paying a small amount of bank as a transfer fee.

Sell a card by offering it on the open market.

Buy a card by bidding for it on the open market.

How do I get more bank?
The are only two ways to acquire bank: junk cards or sell them.

How do auctions work?
Cards are bought and sold in the NationStates Timed Double Auction.

In a Double Auction, buyers and sellers make offers at the same time. A Timed Auction means that when a buyer and seller match, the trade isn't conducted instantly; instead, there is a countdown, during which other parties can beat the offers.

The auction system is designed to force trading at true market prices, reducing the ability of puppet nations to feed valuable cards to their masters.

Auction Rules
For a trade to occur, a bid must equal or exceed an asking price. When this happens, the buyer and seller are matched.

Upon matching, a 60-minute countdown begins. At its expiry, all matches will be executed. This means the card will be sold at its match price, which is calculated as the midpoint of the matched bid and ask. For example, a matched ask of 0.20 and bid of 0.30 will be traded at a match price of 0.25.

During the countdown, other nations can continue to submit bids and asks, potentially changing matches. If a match changes, one minute is added to the countdown.

If there are multiple potentially matching prices, the match will go to the higher bid or lower ask. For example, with an asking price of 0.50 and two bids of 0.60 and 1.00, the higher bid (1.00) will match. The lower bid won't match even though it too exceeds the seller's asking price.

If multiple bids/asks are made at the same price, the earliest is preferred.

If there are multiple matching prices on both sides—both asks and bids—there will be multiple matches, with higher matching bids paired with higher matching asks. When the countdown expires, multiple copies of the card will be traded at once.

Bids and asks cannot be withdrawn while they are matched.

Some notable quirks:

Because the match price is the midpoint of the bid and the ask, buyers will usually pay less than their bid, and sellers will usually receive more than their ask.

If you submit multiple bids/asks on the same card, you could buy/sell multiple copies of it.

It's impossible to beat an ask of 0.01, since that's the minimum price, and earlier offers beat later ones.

When there are multiple matches, they'll resolve at the same time but usually not the same price. Each match has its own match price.

You can't reliably capture a specific bid or ask, so bid/ask what you actually want or else risk being caught out. For example, if you see a high bid on a card, you may be tempted to submit a low ask for it, in order to match. But other offers may then arrive, causing your match to switch to a different, lower bidder.

Can I stop receiving cards?
Yes, you can opt-out of trading cards in your Settings.

What happens to its card if a nation ceases to exist?
Nothing. The cards don't go anywhere.

What happens if my nation ceases to exist?
If your nation ceases to exist and you don't restore it, then eventually your bank and any cards you have collected will be deleted.

What is this fee?
The auction house charges a small fee for the sale of premium cards, which it automatically deducts from the amount due to the seller. Buyers don't pay any fees; only sellers of high-value cards do.

The auction fee is currently 10% of any amount in excess of 10.00 bank. For example, a card sold for 15.00 will net the seller 14.50, since there is an excess of 5.00, and 10% of this amount is 0.50. Cards sold for under 10.00 bank don't incur any fees, and the seller receives the full amount paid by the buyer.



The NationStates API helps scripts and bots interact with the site. It is faster than scraping regular HTML pages, easier on our servers, and the data format is guaranteed not to change unexpectedly. It is also the only way to legally automatically perform certain actions, such as sending telegrams and answering issues.

If your script interacts with regular HTML NationStates pages instead of using this API, you are bound by a bunch of special rules: Please read these Script Rules for HTML site.

If you're just getting started, you might want to use a pre-written wrapper rather than interact with this API directly! See Examples: Wrappers.

Please post feedback and questions in the API forum thread.

Daily Data Dumps
If you need data on large numbers of nations or regions, it's fastest to use a daily dump file, which combines info on every nation/region/card/whatever into a single file. These are generated once per day at around 22:30 PST. They are fairly large (approx. 40MB for nations, 7MB for regions, and 12MB for cards) and compressed with gzip.

Regions
https://www.nationstates.net/pages/regions.xml.gz

Nations
https://www.nationstates.net/pages/nations.xml.gz

The advantage of the Daily Dump is it gives you data for far more nations and regions than you can practically retrieve via API calls. The disadvantages are that the data is up to 24 hours old, not live, and it doesn't include all the information you might want (not all shards).

Some people use a combination of API calls and dump files. This is a good idea if you want to compare a nation to others in its region. Since regions can contain thousands of nations, it's not practical to request data on all a nation's neighbors at once via the API. Instead, try building region-wide stats (e.g. total region population) using the most recent daily dump, and only drawing on the API for up-to-the-second information on the nation in question.

Daily Dumps from the past are archived here.

There's also a one-off dump for Trading Cards, generated shortly after the start of each new season. It's not refreshed because cards are permanently inscribed (barrying modly intervention) and thedata doesn't change over time.

APIs
Nation API
Standard
A compendium of the most commonly sought information. If you don't need most of this data, please use shards (below) instead.

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?nation=(name)

... where (name) is the name of a nation (e.g. "The Grendels" or "the_grendels"). Names are not case-sensitive, but spaces in URLs generally need to be encoded, i.e. replaced with + or %20 or _.

Public Shards
Request exactly what you want! This is faster for us to generate, and can be used to request data not available from the Standard API.

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?nation=(name)&q=(shard1)+(shard2)+(...)

... where you can string together as many shards as you like, separated by + signs. Public shards provide information on any nation in the world and don't require authentication. They are:

admirable admirables animal animaltrait answered banner* banners* capital category census** crime currency customleader customcapital customreligion dbid deaths demonym demonym2 demonym2plural dispatches dispatchlist endorsements factbooks factbooklist firstlogin flag founded foundedtime freedom fullname gavote gdp govt govtdesc govtpriority happenings income industrydesc influence influencenum lastactivity lastlogin leader legislation majorindustry motto name notable notables nstats policies poorest population publicsector rcensus region religion richest scvote sectors sensibilities tax tgcanrecruit*** tgcancampaign*** type wa wabadges wcensus zombie****

* banner: Returns one Rift banner code that should be displayed for this nation: the nation's primary banner, if one is set; otherwise a randomly chosen eligible banner. The banners shard returns a list of Rift banners that should be displayed: the nation's primary banner (if any) is always listed first, with the remainder in random order. Banner codes can be converted into image URLs by prepending "/images/banners/" and appending ".jpg".

** census: By default, returns the score, rank, and region rank on today's featured World Census scale. Can be optionally configured with additional parameters:

scale=(census ID/s): Specify the World Census scale(s) to list, using numerical IDs. The IDs can be found here or in the URL of World Census pages. Separate multiple scales with +. For all scales, use all.
mode=(name/s): Specify the data you want, separating multiple modes with +.
score: Raw value
rank: World rank (e.g. "334" means 334th in the world)
rrank: Region rank
prank: World rank as a percentage (e.g. "15" means "Top 15%")
prrank: Region rank as a percentage
history: This is a special mode that cannot be combined with other modes, as only scores are available, not ranks. When requesting history, you can optionally specify a time window, using Unix epoch times:
from=(timestamp)
to=(timestamp)
*** tgcanrecruit / tgcancampaign: Returns 1 if the nation will receive a telegram of this type, and 0 if not (because it has blocked recruitment TGs, for example, or is a Class nation). You may optionally supply from=(region_name) which allows the check to also examine whether nations will deny a telegram from that region in particular due to having received one too recently.

**** zombie: For use during Z-Day (October 31), when NationStates is traditionally overrun with zombies.

If you are looking for the Number of WA Endorsements, use q=census;scale=66;mode=score or count the entries returned by endorsements.

Where possible, please combine multiple shards into a single request, rather than making multiple requests for different shards for the same nation.

Private Shards
These provide access to information that can only be viewed by a logged-in nation, such as its telegrams or issues. They follow the exact same format as public shards, and indeed you can mix and match public and private shards in a single request. However, any request that includes a private shard must authenticate. They are:

dossier* issues issuesummary nextissue nextissuetime notices* packs ping** rdossier* unread

* notices by default displays only new (unread) notices, as well as notices less than 48 hours old, just like on the regular site. For more notices, supply the optional parameter from=(timestamp), where (timestamp) is a Unix epoch time.

** ping is ideal for when you don't want to do anything except register a login, to prevent the nation from ceasing to exist due to inactivity.

See: Authenticating for Private Shards.

Private Commands
Private Commands allow your nation to do things, such as answer issues. They are very similar in practice to Private Shards, but are for taking action, rather than simply gathering information. They are requested with c=(command name), rather than "q=(shard name)".

You must authenticate for Private Commands in the exact same way as for Private Shards.

Most Private Commands require a two-step process: first you must prepare the request, then execute it (see below).

Available Private Commands:

issue: Address an Issue

To answer an issue, specify c=issue as well as issue=(number) option=(number)

To dismiss an issue, send option=-1

You can fetch the associated text for an issue by using the issues Nation Private Shard. Note that Option ID numbers begin counting at zero.

This command will return XML describing the result of the passed legislation. It may include these XML elements: OK ERROR DESC RANKINGS UNLOCKS RECLASSIFICATIONS NEW_POLICIES REMOVED_POLICIES

Example: To enact legislation in Testlandia for Issue #111 using Option #2:

curl -H "X-Password: hunter2" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=issue&issue=111&option=2"

giftcard: Gift a Trading Card

BETA: Currently in development. Subject to change without warning.

To send a Trading Card you own to another nation, specify c=giftcard as well as cardid=(number) season=(number) to=(nation name)

Follow the two-step process to first prepare and then execute a Private Command.

Example: To send a Season 1 "Mindless contempt" card from Testlandia to Frisbeeteria:

curl -H "X-Password: hunter2" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=giftcard&cardid=159058&season=1&to=frisbeeteria&mode=prepare

curl -H "X-Pin: 1234567890" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=giftcard&cardid=159058&season=1&to=frisbeeteria&mode=execute&token=123456789abcdefg

junkcard: Junk a Trading Card

BETA: Currently in development. Subject to change without warning.

To junk a Trading Card, specify c=junkcard as well as cardid=(number) season=(number)

Follow the two-step process to first prepare and then execute a Private Command.

curl -H "X-Password: hunter2" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=junkcard&cardid=159058&season=1&mode=prepare

curl -H "X-Pin: 1234567890" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=junkcard&cardid=159058&season=1&mode=execute&token=123456789abcdefg

dispatch: Write a Dispatch

BETA: Currently in development. Subject to change without warning.

To add, edit, or remove a dispatch, specify c=dispatch as well as dispatch=(action) where the action is one of these three values: add edit remove

When adding or editing a dispatch, specify: title=(text) text=(text) category=(number) subcategory=(number)

When editing or removing a dispatch, you must also specify: dispatchid=(number)

Follow the two-step process to first prepare and then execute a Private Command.

Examples: To create a new dispatch:

curl -H "X-Password: hunter2" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=dispatch&dispatch=add&title=Test%20Dispatch&text=Hello%20there.&category=1&subcategory=105&mode=prepare"

curl -H "X-Pin: 1234567890" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=dispatch&dispatch=add&title=Test%20Dispatch&text=Hello%20there.&category=1&subcategory=105&mode=execute&token=1234567890abcdefg"

Example: To edit that dispatch:

curl -H "X-Pin: 1234567890" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=dispatch&dispatch=edit&dispatchid=123456&title=Test%20Dispatch%20Edited&text=I%20Was%20Edited.&category=1&subcategory=105&mode=prepare"

Example: To remove that dispatch:

curl -H "X-Pin: 1234567890" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=dispatch&dispatch=remove&dispatchid=123456&mode=prepare"

curl -H "X-Pin: 1234567890" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=dispatch&dispatch=remove&dispatchid=123456&mode=execute&token=1234567890abcdefg"

rmbpost: Post to a regional RMB

BETA: Currently in development. Subject to change without warning.

To post a message to a regional message board, specify c=rmbpost as well as these three parameters: nation=(text) region=(text) text=(text) mode=(text)

Follow the two-step process to first prepare and then execute a Private Command.

Examples: To create a new dispatch:

curl -H "X-Password: hunter2" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=rmbpost&region=testregionia&text=Hello%20there.&mode=prepare"

curl -H "X-Pin: 1234567890" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi" --data "nation=testlandia&c=rmbpost&region=testregionia&text=Hello%20there.&mode=execute&token=1234567890abcdefg"

Preparing & Executing Private Commands
All Private Commands except issue should be performed as a two step process:

First prepare the command, by sending your request to the API with the following parameter appended: mode=prepare

Now execute the command by re-sending the same request, only this time appending the following two parameters, using the data that the server returned to you in the first step: mode=execute token=(string)

The server will not honor duplicate requests; i.e. attempts to perform the same action multiple times with the same token. You need to perform the two-step process each time: prepare, then execute.

Since you will probably be performing these two requests in quick succession, be aware of how Authenticating For Private Shards & Commands work. In particular, note that you cannot login twice in quick succession with X-Password or X-Autologin: instead, you should use X-Pin for your subsequent requests.

Authenticating For Private Shards & Commands
In order to access a private shard, you must:

Connect via HTTPS (not HTTP)

Include one or more of the following headers:

X-Pin An integer like: 1234567890

X-Password A string like: hunter2

X-Autologin A string like: rjK,CEu9b6T5A45zkvHtA

For example, if Testlandia's password were "hunter2", you could use curl to retrieve its unread notifications like this:

curl -H "X-Password: hunter2" -A "UserAgent Example" "https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?nation=testlandia&q=unread"

This example also sets a UserAgent, which is mandatory, and identifies your script to us.

The authentication process works like this:

A flowchart of API authentication process. Requests with a valid PIN always succeed, while other requests may throw a 409 Conflict error.

The first time you access a private shard, you will probably provide X-Password, since that's all you know. It's fine to keep doing this for all requests in some circumstances, such as if you are running your own script on your own computer, which only makes one request every so often. However, you may want to switch to X-Autologin, which is an encrypted version of your password, to avoid having to store it anywhere in plaintext. Whenever you authenticate with X-Password, the server response will include an X-Autologin header with the code you need, which will work until the nation's password is changed.

If you plan on making multiple requests for private shards in quick succession for the same nation, you need to use X-Pin. This is a session identifier, created when the nation logs in, and persisting until it logs out or goes idle for two hours. Whenever you authenticate with either X-Password or X-Autologin, the server response will include an X-Pin header with the number you need. This number will work until the nation logs out.

The advantage of X-Pin is it skips the heavy authentication checks that are required when a nation logs in, allowing you to quickly make multiple requests. Without this, you may encounter a 409 Conflict error, which is triggered when a nation attempts to log in via the API despite having successfully logged in very recently (within a few seconds). To make multiple requests in a short period of time, then, your script should first authenticate with X-Password or X-Autologin, note the value of the X-Pin header returned, and for future requests supply that in your own X-Pin header.

You can supply one, two, or all three authentication headers with each request, and these will be processed as shown by the flowchart above—notably, X-Pin will always be used first if it's valid.

The Gotcha: Logging in cancels any existing session, invalidating its Pin. This means that if you have a script running in the background while also browsing NationStates manually, the two will fight each other, with a request from one logging out the other. This can go unnoticed in your browser, assuming you have autologin turned on, because you don't realize you are silently reauthenticating with each click. But you will notice it via the API because too-frequent logins generate a 409 Conflict error.

This will also happen if you have multiple scripts that don't share Pins. If each one only keeps track of its own session, then a request from one will invalidate the Pin of the other.

World API
Shards
Look up data about the game world.

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?q=(shard1)+(shard2)+(...)

Available shards:

banner1 census2 censusid censusdesc3 censusname3 censusranks3 censusscale3 censustitle3 dispatch dispatchlist4 faction5 factions5 featuredregion happenings6 lasteventid nations newnations newnationdetails numnations numregions poll regions regionsbytag7 tgqueue

1 banner: Supply a comma-separated list of banner IDs with banner=(list)

2 census: See the nation shard for details.

3 censusname, censusscale, etc: Return information on the day's featured World Census ranking by default. You can optionally specify a scale by adding scale=(ID number).

3 censusranks: Accepts an optional parameter start=(rank number).

4 dispatchlist: Configure by appending optional extra parameters:

dispatchauthor=(nation name) to list dispatches authored by a particular nation.
dispatchcategory=(category name) to list dispatches belonging to a particular category, such as "Factbook" or "Bulletin".
dispatchcategory=(category name):(subcategory name) to list dispatches belonging to a particular subcategory, such as "Factbook:Geography".
dispatchsort=(sort type) to specify a sort type: "new" or "best". (Default: new.)
You can combine the above, e.g. Best ever Factbook:History dispatches.

Full individual dispatches (including text) can be looked up with the dispatch shard.

5 faction and factions are only available during N-Day, when nations are conducting nuclear exchanges.

6 happenings: Configure by appending optional extra parameters:

view=(type) to confine the results to a particular set of nations. Valid view types are:
view=nation.(nation name) One particular nation
view=nation.(comma-separated nation names) A list of nations
view=region.(region name) Residents of one particular region
view=region.(comma-separated region names) A list of regions
filter=(type) to specify a list of filters, separated by +. Available filters: law change dispatch rmb embassy eject admin move founding cte vote resolution member endo
limit=(number) to set a maximum number of results
sinceid=(number) to restrict results to only those with a higher EVENT ID than the number specified. You may want to use this when regularly polling the API, to avoid having to process the same results over and over.
beforeid=(number) The opposite of the above. Useful if you want to allow paging through data, by only returning results older than a particular EVENT ID.
sincetime=(timestamp) to restrict results to only those that occurred more recently than the given timestamp.
beforetime=(timestamp) to restrict results to only those that occurred earlier than the given timestamp.
You may combine the above; for example, like this.

The happenings shard has a 28-second delay between a nation doing something and it becoming visible via this API. This is reflected in the id of the event shown through lasteventid: the lasteventid shard shows the event id of the last event currently available through the happenings shard.

7 regionsbytag: You can add tag names as ;tags=(tagname1),(tagname2), up to a maximum of 10 tags. This will list all regions belonging to any of the named tags. Tags can be preceded by a - to select regions which do not have that tag; for example, like this. For a full list of tag names, see the Tag Cloud.

World Assembly API
Shards
Look up data about the World Assembly.

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?wa=(council_id)&q=(shard1)+(shard2)+(...)

... where council_id is 1 for the General Assembly and 2 for the Security Council. In the case of shards that return data for the overall World Assembly (e.g. numnations), it doesn't matter which council_id you use: either will return the same result.

Available shards:

numnations numdelegates delegates members happenings proposals resolution voters* votetrack* dellog* delvotes* lastresolution

* Shards marked with an asterisk, such as dellog, are only available when used in conjunction with resolution for the current at-vote resolution.

You can also specify a resolution with id:

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?wa=(council_id)&id=(resolution_id)&q=resolution

If you omit id, you will get information on the current at-vote resolution.

Telegrams API
The Telegrams API exists to support things that aren't possible using the in-game Mass Telegram system; for example, automatically targeting telegrams at nations with capitalist leanings in regions with more than 50 residents. It's also possible to duplicate what the in-game system offers you via Telegram Stamps, only slower.

Important Note: You must use this API if you want to send telegrams with a script or browser tool. Using a script or tool to send telegrams from the regular Telegrams page is a violation of our Script Rules, and may lead to deletion of your nation as well as penalties for the region for which you are recruiting.

Telegram API Rate Limits
The Telegrams API imposes an additional rate limit:

Recruitment TGs: 1 telegram per 180 seconds

Non-recruitment TGs: 1 telegram per 30 seconds

(These rate limits may change in the future.)

If you attempt to send telegrams faster than this, your request will fail, and the response will include a 'X-Retry-After' header with information on when you can try again successfully. There is no penalty for trying too soon, although each request does count toward your overall API Rate Limit.

The Telegrams API Rate Limit works by checking the amount of time that has passed since your last successful request. For example, if you sent a telegram via the API 60 seconds ago, you can now successfully send a non-recruitment telegram (since 60 is greater than 30), but not a recruitment telegram (since 60 is less than 180).

Telegrams API Client Key
Unlike the rest of the API, to use the Telegrams API you need an API Client Key. Currently, you can do this by lodging a Help Request with the moderators, describing:

The purpose of your script (e.g. to send recruitment TGs, welcome-to-my-region TGs...)

The region your script will be serving

The nation primarily responsible for the script

API Client Keys are tied to a particular region, and each region may only have one (although they can be revoked and re-issued). Multiple people and scripts within a region can use the same API Client Key. If they do, they will be bound by the same rate limit: that is, when anyone uses the API Client Key to send a recruitment telegram, no-one else using the same API Client Key will be able to send more messages until the rate limit expires.

Once approved, a moderator will telegram you an API Client Key, which you can use for future API calls.

You are responsible for all use of your Telegrams API Client Key. If you suspect that it is not being used appropriately, please immediately contact the moderators.

(This process is still being developed and may change in the future. It is currently mostly geared around the idea of using the Telegrams API to send recruitment telegrams for a particular region, and may be confusing to people wishing to do other things as well. If you are unsure, please file a Help Request or post in the Technical Forum.)

To send telegrams via the API
If you haven't already, obtain a Telegrams API Client Key, as described above.

Compose your telegram, addressing it to tag:api and click Send. (Tip: When composing, you may wish to make use of the %NATION% macro—see here.)

Your telegram will be registered as an API template, and you will be shown instructions on how to deliver it. This entails noting two pieces of information: its TGID and its Secret Key. You can then use these to make API calls to:

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?a=sendTG&client=(Client Key)&tgid=(TGID)&key=(Secret Key)&to=(nation_name)

You must make one API call per recipient. If, for example, you want to send a message to 1,000 recipients, you need to compose the telegram, send it to tag:api, then make 1,000 API calls, spaced sufficiently far apart to abide by the ratelimit, to deliver all copies.

Never share your telegram's Secret Key, as this will allow others to send your telegram to the recipients of their choice. You are responsible for all usage of your keys.

If you need to look up your telegram's TGID or Secret Key again, it can be found in the Delivery Reports section of your telegram, in your Sent Items folder.

Verification API
This can be used by a third-party website to verify that a user owns a particular nation, without requiring that user to divulge sensitive information.

Steps:

Ask the user to visit https://www.nationstates.net/page=verify_login and enter the code displayed into your website.

Have your site make a request to:

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?a=verify&nation=(Nation Name)&checksum=(code)

The API will return 1 if the checksum code is correct for the specified logged-in nation. If the code is incorrect, or the nation does not exist, or is not currently logged in, the API will return 0.

The code will expire if the nation logs out, if it performs a significant in-game action such as moving regions or endorsing another nation, and after it is successfully verified.

The code only allows nation verification by a third party website, and does not provide any extra access to or control over the nation.

Adding a site-specific token
For additional security, a third-party site can optionally add its own token to the verification process. This means that the generated checksum code will only be valid for that site. Without this, it is possible for a third-party site to use the user's supplied checksum code to impersonate them on a separate third-party site.

Steps:

Append ?token=(Your token) to the verify_login URL you ask the user to visit, where your token is a string of characters you generate and is unique to that nation. The important thing is that you should be able to re-generate the same token given the same nation name, but nobody else knows how you do it. For example, you might produce an MD5 hash of the nation name using a private key. Your user then fetches their code from this URL: https://www.nationstates.net/page=verify_login?token=(Your token).

Append the same token to your API request:

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?a=verify&nation=(Nation Name)&checksum=(code)&token=(Your token)

Combining verification with shards
You can combine verification with a request for nation data into a single call by appending &q=(shard). In this case, the result of the verification (1 or 0) is returned within <VERIFY> tags as XML:

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?a=verify&nation=(Nation Name)&checksum=(code)&q=(shard1)+(shard2)+(...)

Server-Sent Events
BETA: Currently in development. Subject to change without warning.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow you to receive real-time streams of NationStates Happenings data without repeatedly polling the API. You can subscribe to one or more "buckets" of events (e.g. law, change, dispatch). Benefits:

Real-time updates: You get notified as soon as an event happens

Your requests aren't limited by API Rate Limits

Reduced server load: Helps prevent our servers from catching fire

Basic Usage
To subscribe to an SSE feed, make a request to:

https://www.nationstates.net/api/(bucket1)+(bucket2)+(...)
where:

bucket1, bucket2, ... correspond to any of the buckets (described below) that you want to subscribe to. You may specify multiple buckets by joining them with +.
Buckets
The buckets you can subscribe to match the same event categories used by the World API happenings shard. These include:

law change dispatch rmb embassy eject admin move founding cte vote resolution member endo nation:(nation name) region:(region name)
Including multiple buckets will return all events belonging to any one of the buckets. For instance, dispatch+move+cte will include dispatch-related events, nation movements, and nations ceasing to exist.

Event Format
A typical event will be a JSON object with the following keys:

id: A unique identifier for the event.
time: The time at which the event occurred.
str: A string containing the full details of the happening such as nation/region names, and descriptive text.
Restrictions
As SSE connections can be held open indefinitely, there are two limits on its use: a limit per-IP, and a global limit for all users. If either of these limits are exceeded, the SSE endpoint will return status 429.

The per-IP limit is 5 concurrent connections. It is possible that connections are "held open" from our persepective for longer than you may expect, if the connection is not properly closed. If this limit is exceeded, you will receive status 429 with the message Too Many Requests: Connection limit exceeded for your IP. Please try again later. Attempts to circumvent this limit will be harshly punished.

The global limit is not publiscised. It is set sufficiently high that we do not anticipate it being exceeded by normal use of SSE. If this limit is exceeded, you will receive status 429 with the message Too Many Requests: The SSE server is full. Please try again later. If you encounter this message, we encourage you to notify us, via GHR or via forum post.

Rate Limits
The API is rate-limited and will temporarily lock you out if you send too many requests within a short period of time. (And return status 429: "Too Many Requests From Your IP Address.")

API Rate Limit: 50 requests per 30 seconds.

The API uses a so-called "flush bucket" to enforce this. In other words, when you send your first request, the API begins counting your requests for the next 30 seconds (the time window). If you send more than 50 in that time, it will return status 429 and the header 'Retry-After: n', where n is the number of seconds until you can make another request. Once the time window has elapsed, a new time window starts and you can send requests again. This means that if you hit on the rate limit a few times, the API won't penalize you, only locking you out until the time window ends. However, if the API detects that you are doing this a lot, it will lock you out for 15 minutes or longer. This is designed to let multiple sensible scripts running at the same time without much disruption.

Several headers are returned to help scripts obey rate limits without risk of locking out. These are based on current efforts to standardize rate limiting headers for HTTP; see here for details. These headers give scripts all the information they need to rate limit correctly without needing to hardcode values. You shouldn't hardcode the ratelimit, but rather use these headers. The headers that the API sends are:

RateLimit-Policy: Set to "50;w=30" and describes the API's policy for rate limiting.
RateLimit-Limit: Set to "50"; which means that there are a total of 50 requests available in the current time window (bucket). You should use this value rather than hardcoding 50.
RateLimit-Remaining: How many more requests can be made within the current time window.
RateLimit-Reset: Number of seconds remaining in the current time window.
Retry-After: Once blocked from accessing the API, your script should wait this amount of seconds before trying again.
A "request" is an HTTP request to the site for any amount of information and any number of shards. That is, an HTTP request like this is a single request, even though it gathers information on three shards.

As per the Telegrams API documentation, an additional limit applies when sending TGs.

Scraping
The API is designed to support scripts that need to fetch small amounts of real-time data quickly. If instead you need large amounts of world-wide or historical data, e.g. a region's entire Regional Message Board, or information from thousands of nations at once, you should not flood us with API requests.

In particular, it is not feasible to use the API to gather data on every nation in a region at once. If you need region-wide stats that can only be gathered by examining nations, you should compile these from Daily Data Dumps rather than dozens/hundreds/thousands of real-time API requests. For example, if your script wants to allow users to compare their nation's Civil Rights to the rest of the region:

Wrong Way: Use the API to fetch Civil Rights scores for each nation in that region one at a time. Wrong because large regions will cause your script to exceed the Rate Limit (and/or be very slow), and because it must re-load the same nations each and every time a user from that region visits your site.

Right Way: Use Daily Dumps to build region-wide Civil Rights stats in advance, then use the API only to gather data from the user's nation. Alternately, use the Region API "censuscore" shard to request a single region-wide Civil Rights average.

The Daily Data Dumps are only updated once every 24 hours, and scripts should not download them more frequently.

If you must use the API for scraping historical data that isn't contained in Daily Dumps, please do so at a rate well below the maximum, e.g. 1 request per second. Please also respect copyright.

Terms of Use
Generally, you can use the API however you like, and if you try to do something that isn't allowed, your request will simply be denied. For example, there's no punishment for exceeding the rate limit; it simply won't work.

There are, however, a few basic rules you must follow, or we may remove your access to the API or the site in general.

Set a User Agent
You must set your script's UserAgent to something informative, such as the URL of your site or your e-mail address. It can be whatever you want, so long as it allows us to contact you if something goes wrong with your script. If you don't set a UserAgent, you will receive response status 403 "Forbidden" and some explanatory text.

Check your UserAgent here.

Do Not Sneakily Exceed Rate Limits
You must not deliberately attempt to avoid being rate-limited, e.g. by splitting your API requests across different IP addresses so that they appear to come from different people, or using puppet nations to obtain multiple Telegrams API Client Keys in order to send telegrams faster.

Be Transparent
You must not present deceptive or misleading information, e.g. spoofing an IP address, setting a misleading User Agent, obtaining an API Client Key under false pretenses.

API Versions
From time to time, the API may be updated to include new data or change format. If your scripts will regularly contact the server and might stop working when confronted with an unexpected new format, you can make them request a particular API version number. You do this by appending &v=1 to your request, replacing "1" with whichever version number you want.

For example, if the current API version when you write your script is 2, you can send requests like this:

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?nation=testlandia&v=2

... or this (using shards):

https://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/api.cgi?nation=testlandia&q=motto+animal+currency&v=2

... and if the API later changes to version 3, your scripts will continue to receive data in the unchanged version 2 format. This allows you to decide whether the new API version is worth upgrading to, and whether it will break anything, at your leisure.

Check the current API Version here.

If you omit the v parameter, you receive the most recent version of the API.

Note: The Daily Data Dumps are always compiled in the current API version—there is no way to retrieve a Data Dump in an older API version format, sorry. If you use Data Dumps, in order to prevent breakage your script should inspect the version number at the top of the XML file (e.g.: <NATIONS api_version="2">) and abort if it is different than you expect.

NationStates supports the two most recent API versions. Older versions may stop working without notice. For example, if the current API version is 6, then versions 5 and 6 are supported, but versions 1-4 are no longer maintained. You may find that an unsupported API version will suddently default to the most recent API version instead. Historically, each API version has remained current for 6-12 months.
