# Legacy Documentation (v1.0 - v1.1)

These files were moved from the root `docs/` directory during the October 2025 refresh. They capture historical implementation details and audit reports for earlier releases (v1.0 through v1.1).

**Archive Structure Consolidated: October 31, 2025**
- Flattened unnecessarily deep nesting from `archived/` subdirectory
- All v1.0-v1.1 historical documents now at `/docs/archive/v1/`
- Audit reports organized in `/docs/archive/v1/audits/`

## Contents

This archive contains:
- **62 historical documentation files** covering v1.0-v1.1 implementations
- **Technical guides**: Architecture, systems, integration, and implementation summaries
- **Audit reports**: Comprehensive progress reports and compliance audits (in `audits/` subdirectory)
- **Legacy test files**: Scripts and test results for debugging and validation

## Usage

Use these files for **reference only**. Active documentation now lives under the refreshed structure in `docs/`.

For current documentation, see:
- `/docs/` - Active v1.2+ documentation
- `/docs/archive/` - Recent archived documentation (v1.2+)
