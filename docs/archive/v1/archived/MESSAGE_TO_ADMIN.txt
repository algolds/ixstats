Hi IIWiki Admin,

I'm reaching out regarding the IxStats-Builder application that needs access to the IIWiki MediaWiki API. Despite our earlier discussion about whitelisting, we're still encountering Cloudflare 403 challenges.

Here are the specific details:

SERVER INFORMATION:
- Server IP: 45.32.6.57
- User-Agent: IxStats-Builder
- Target API: https://iiwiki.com/mediawiki/api.php

CURRENT ISSUE:
All API requests are returning HTTP 403 with Cloudflare JavaScript challenge pages, which cannot be completed by automated systems.

REQUESTED CLOUDFLARE CONFIGURATION:
Please create a WAF Skip Rule with these exact settings:

Rule Name: Allow IxStats Builder API Access
Expression: (ip.src eq 45.32.6.57 and http.request.uri.path contains "/mediawiki/api.php")
Action: Skip
Skip Options: [Select All] - All remaining custom rules, Rate limiting, Zone Lockdown, Security level
Priority: 1 (must run before any blocking rules)
Status: Enabled

ALTERNATIVE (if WAF rule doesn't work):
Go to Security > WAF > Tools > IP Access Rules
Add: IP 45.32.6.57, Action: Whitelist, Zone: iiwiki.com

TESTING:
After configuration, I can verify with:
curl -A "IxStats-Builder" "https://iiwiki.com/mediawiki/api.php?action=query&format=json&meta=siteinfo"

Expected: HTTP 200 with JSON response (not a challenge page)

IMPORTANT CHECKLIST:
✓ IP is exactly: 45.32.6.57
✓ Path contains: /mediawiki/api.php (using "contains", not "equals")
✓ Action is "Skip" not just "Allow"
✓ Rule is "Enabled" not just saved
✓ Rule priority is higher than blocking rules

I've attached detailed documentation (IIWIKI_CLOUDFLARE_DEBUG.md) with complete configuration steps and troubleshooting information.

Let me know if you need any additional information or if you see different IP addresses in your logs.

Thanks for your help!
