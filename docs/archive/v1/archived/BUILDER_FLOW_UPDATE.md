# Builder Flow Update - October 2025

## Updated Builder Sequence

The MyCountry Builder now follows this logical progression:

### Phase 1: Foundation Selection
**Pre-Builder Step**
- Select foundation country from 180+ real-world economies
- Automatic data population based on selection

### Phase 2: Core Indicators & National Identity
**Section 1: Core Indicators** (Starting Point)
- National symbols (flag, coat of arms)
- Country name and official name
- Basic information (capital, language, currency)
- GDP, population, growth rates
- Economic tier classification

### Phase 3: Government Structure
**Section 2: Government Builder**
- Government departments and ministries
- Organizational structure
- Budget allocation framework

**Section 3: Government Spending**
- Education, healthcare, infrastructure
- Detailed budget allocation by sector
- Spending priorities and effectiveness

### Phase 4: Economic System
**Section 4: Economy Builder** (NEW - Comprehensive)
- Employment metrics and sector distribution
- Income distribution and inequality
- Economic sectors and productivity
- International trade and FDI
- Competitiveness and innovation

**Section 5: Tax Builder** (Fiscal System)
- Tax rates (income, corporate, sales, etc.)
- Revenue projections
- Debt management
- Fiscal sustainability

### Phase 5: Detailed Metrics
**Section 6: Labor & Employment**
- Detailed workforce analysis
- Wages and working conditions
- Employment types and demographics

**Section 7: Demographics**
- Age distribution
- Social structure
- Regional breakdown
- Education levels

### Phase 6: Additional (Optional)
**Section 8: National Identity** (Optional - can be integrated into Core Indicators)
- Additional cultural information
- Historical background
- National symbols detail

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed 403 Wiki API Error
**Problem**: HTTP 403 Forbidden when searching for country flags/images
**Solution**:
- Added CORS headers (`origin: '*'`)
- Graceful error handling (returns empty array instead of throwing)
- Better error logging for debugging
- Fallback to empty results on access restrictions

### 2. Reorganized Section Order
**Old Order**:
1. National Identity
2. Core Indicators
3. Comprehensive Economy
4. Labor & Employment
5. Fiscal System
6. Government Spending
7. Government Structure
8. Demographics

**New Order** (matches logical flow):
1. **Core Indicators** (includes national symbols/identity)
2. **Government Builder**
3. **Government Spending**
4. **Economy Builder**
5. **Tax Builder** (Fiscal System)
6. **Labor & Employment**
7. **Demographics**
8. National Identity (optional/additional)

### 3. Renamed Sections for Clarity
- "Fiscal System" → "Tax Builder" (clearer purpose)
- "Government Structure" → "Government Builder" (consistency)
- "Comprehensive Economy" → "Economy Builder" (brevity)
- Updated "Core Indicators" description to include national symbols

## Builder Flow Logic

```
User Journey:
1. Select Foundation Country
   ↓
2. Core Indicators (name, symbols, GDP, population)
   ↓
3. Government Builder (structure)
   ↓
4. Government Spending (budget allocation)
   ↓
5. Economy Builder (comprehensive economic analysis)
   ↓
6. Tax Builder (fiscal policy)
   ↓
7. Labor & Employment (workforce details)
   ↓
8. Demographics (population structure)
   ↓
9. Preview & Save
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/wiki-search-service.ts`**
   - Added CORS origin parameter
   - Graceful 403 error handling
   - Better error logging
   - Returns empty array on access restrictions

2. **`src/app/builder/utils/sectionData.ts`**
   - Reordered sections to match logical flow
   - Added phase comments
   - Updated section names and descriptions
   - Merged national symbols into Core Indicators

3. **`src/app/builder/components/enhanced/EconomicCustomizationHub.tsx`**
   - Changed default active section from 'symbols' to 'core'
   - Updated to reflect new section order

### Error Handling Improvements

**Before**:
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  if (response.status === 403) {
    console.warn(`403 Forbidden - API blocking requests. Returning empty results.`);
    return [];
  }
  throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
}
```

## Benefits of New Flow

### 1. Logical Progression
- Start with identity and basic metrics
- Build government structure before allocating budgets
- Define economy before setting tax policy
- Add detailed metrics after main framework

### 2. Reduced Cognitive Load
- Each section builds on the previous
- Natural progression from macro to micro
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Better User Experience
- No more 403 errors breaking the flow
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Clear section naming (Builder, not System)

### 4. Educational Value
- Users understand cause-effect relationships
- Policy decisions flow logically
- Economic outcomes follow government structure

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- Section data structure unchanged (IDs remain same)
- All calculations and integrations still work
- Only display order and default starting point changed

### For Developers
- Update any hardcoded section references to use IDs, not order
- National symbols should be in Core Indicators section
- Test with 'core' as starting section instead of 'symbols'

## Future Enhancements

1. **Merge National Identity into Core Indicators**
   - Single unified "Core Indicators & Identity" section
   - Reduces section count from 8 to 7
   - Streamlines initial setup

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Show/hide sections based on completion
   - Guide users through optimal flow
   - Prevent skipping critical sections

3. **Section Dependencies**
   - Lock sections until prerequisites complete
   - Visual flow diagram showing progress
   - Smart suggestions for next steps

4. **Improved Flag/Symbol Handling**
   - Alternative image sources if wiki APIs fail
   - Manual upload as primary method
   - Wikimedia Commons as fallback
   - Local placeholder flags for all countries
