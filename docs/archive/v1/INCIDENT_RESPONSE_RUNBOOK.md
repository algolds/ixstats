---

## Incident Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection & Initial Response (0-15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Detect the Incident
**Monitoring Sources**:
- Discord webhook alerts
- Database audit logs (`SystemLog` table)
- Rate limiting violations
- User reports
- Automated security scans

#### 1.2 Create Incident Record
```bash
# Create incident tracking issue
gh issue create --title "SECURITY: [Brief description]" \
  --label "security,incident" \
  --body "Severity: [P0/P1/P2/P3]
Detected: [timestamp]
Detected by: [name]
Initial assessment: [description]"
```

#### 1.3 Assemble Response Team
- Page on-call team based on severity
- Start incident Slack/Discord channel: `#incident-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Start incident timeline log

---

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Immediate Actions

**For Data Breach (P0)**:
```bash
# 1. Isolate affected systems
# 2. Revoke compromised credentials
npm run clerk:revoke-sessions --all-users

# 3. Enable emergency rate limiting
echo "RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10" >> .env.production
pm2 restart ixstats

# 4. Block suspicious IPs (if identified)
# Add to firewall rules or Cloudflare

# 5. Snapshot current state for forensics
npm run db:backup
cp -r logs/ logs-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/
```

**For Authentication Bypass (P1)**:
```bash
# 1. Force all users to re-authenticate
npm run auth:invalidate-all-sessions

# 2. Enable 2FA requirement temporarily
# Update Clerk settings via dashboard

# 3. Review audit logs
npm run logs:query --category=AUTH --since="2 hours ago"
```

**For DDoS Attack (P1)**:
```bash
# 1. Enable aggressive rate limiting
echo "RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=20
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000" >> .env.production

# 2. Enable Cloudflare DDoS protection
# Or switch to "I'm Under Attack" mode

# 3. Scale infrastructure if needed
# Increase server capacity
```

#### 2.2 Evidence Preservation
```bash
# 1. Export relevant logs
npm run logs:export --since="24 hours ago" --output=incident-logs.json

# 2. Database snapshot
npm run db:snapshot --label="incident-$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# 3. Capture network traffic (if applicable)
# tcpdump or relevant tools

# 4. Screenshot dashboards/metrics
# Capture relevant monitoring data
```

---

### Phase 3: Investigation (1-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Root Cause Analysis

**Check SystemLog database**:
```sql
-- Recent critical errors
SELECT * FROM SystemLog
WHERE level = 'CRITICAL'
AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-24 hours')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Suspicious user activity
SELECT userId, COUNT(*) as activity_count,
       MIN(timestamp) as first_seen, MAX(timestamp) as last_seen
FROM SystemLog
WHERE timestamp > datetime('now', '-24 hours')
GROUP BY userId
HAVING activity_count > 1000
ORDER BY activity_count DESC;

-- Failed authentication attempts
SELECT ip, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM SystemLog
WHERE category = 'AUTH'
AND errorMessage IS NOT NULL
AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-1 hour')
GROUP BY ip
HAVING attempts > 10;
```

**Check Clerk audit logs**:
```bash
# Via Clerk Dashboard -> Audit Log
# Or API
curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/audit_logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CLERK_SECRET_KEY}"
```

**Analyze tRPC audit logs**:
```bash
# Check AuditLog table
npm run audit:analyze --since="24 hours ago"
```

#### 3.2 Identify Affected Systems
- List of compromised accounts
- Affected data tables/records
- Exposed API endpoints
- Timeline of access

---

### Phase 4: Remediation (2-8 hours)

#### 4.1 Deploy Fixes

**Security Patch Deployment**:
```bash
# 1. Develop and test fix
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 2. Apply fix
# ... make changes ...

# 3. Test in staging
npm run test
npm run typecheck
npm run build

# 4. Deploy to production
git tag -a security-patch-v$(date +%Y%m%d) -m "Security patch"
git push origin security-patch-v$(date +%Y%m%d)
npm run deploy:prod

# 5. Verify fix
npm run verify:production
```

#### 4.2 Credential Rotation
```bash
# 1. Generate new secrets
# Via Clerk Dashboard, generate new keys

# 2. Update environment variables
# Update .env.production with new keys

# 3. Rotate database credentials (if compromised)
# Update DATABASE_URL

# 4. Update webhook URLs (if needed)
# Generate new Discord webhook URLs

# 5. Restart services with new credentials
pm2 restart all
```

#### 4.3 User Notification (if required)
```typescript
// Use notification system
import { notificationService } from '~/lib/notifications';

await notificationService.sendToAllUsers({
  title: "Security Notice",
  message: "We have detected and resolved a security issue...",
  priority: "HIGH",
  category: "SECURITY"
});
```

---

### Phase 5: Recovery (4-24 hours)

#### 5.1 Restore Normal Operations
```bash
# 1. Verify all systems operational
npm run health:check

# 2. Monitor for 24-48 hours
# Watch logs, metrics, user activity

# 3. Gradually restore rate limits
# Return to normal thresholds
```

#### 5.2 Data Recovery (if needed)
```bash
# Restore from backup if data was corrupted
npm run db:restore --backup=incident-YYYYMMDD --confirm
```

---

### Phase 6: Post-Incident Review (24-72 hours)

#### 6.1 Incident Report Template

- Rate limit violations

**Response**:
1. Immediately lock the account
2. Review audit logs for all activity
3. Check for data accessed
4. Reset user credentials
5. Enable 2FA requirement
6. Notify user

**Commands**:
```bash
# Lock account
npm run user:suspend --userId="[user_id]" --reason="security"

# Review activity
npm run logs:user --userId="[user_id]" --since="7 days ago"

# Force password reset

```

### Scenario 2: SQL Injection Attempt

**Detection**:
- Unusual database queries in logs
- Error messages indicating SQL syntax
- Security scanner alerts

**Response**:

5. Deploy fix immediately
6. Review all similar patterns

### Scenario 3: Rate Limit Abuse

**Detection**:
- High volume from single IP
- Rate limiter warnings in logs

**Response**:
1. Identify the source IP
2. Temporarily block if malicious
3. Increase rate limits if legitimate use
4. Monitor for continued abuse

**Commands**:
```bash
# Check rate limit violations
npm run logs:query --category=SECURITY --filter="rate_limit"

# Block IP temporarily (via firewall or Cloudflare)
```

### Scenario 4: Dependency Vulnerability

**Detection**:
- Dependabot alert
- npm audit warning
- Security scanner finding

**Response**:
1. Assess severity and exploitability
2. Check if dependency is actively used
3. Update to patched version
4. Test thoroughly
5. Deploy update
