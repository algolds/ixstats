# IxStats Documentation Hub

> **🆕 NEW (November 2025):** The messaging system has been unified! All messaging—personal, diplomatic, and official—now uses **ThinkShare** as the single backbone. See [systems/UNIFIED_MESSAGING_SYSTEM.md](./systems/UNIFIED_MESSAGING_SYSTEM.md) for complete details.

This repository refresh introduces a streamlined documentation set that mirrors the current codebase. The guides are grouped by purpose so engineers, storytellers, and operators can quickly land in the right place.

- **Overview** – product positioning, feature map, quick facts
- **Architecture** – frontend, backend, and data internals
- **Systems** – deep dives for each major gameplay or management module
- **Operations** – environment management, deployments, monitoring
- **Processes** – testing, contributing, incident workflows
- **Reference** – API, database, and event schemas

Legacy documents have been relocated to `docs/archive/v1`. Keep them for historical context, but use the refreshed material below for all future work.

## How to Maintain This Documentation
1. Update Markdown alongside code changes—especially READMEs in feature directories and the relevant system guide.
2. Run or extend automation in `scripts/audit` when adding routers, models, or calculations; capture outputs in the reference docs.
3. Keep `/help` synchronized with the Markdown guides so users receive the same guidance in-app and in the repository.
4. Move outdated docs to `docs/archive/<date>` instead of deleting them when retiring features.
5. Keep root directory clean—only active documents (README, CLAUDE, CHANGELOG, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS).

The documentation refresh targets accuracy as of October 22, 2025 (v1.1.3). Treat the structure as the source of truth going forward.
