Maps System Enhancement Plan - 5 Critical Priorities 1. 🗺️ Implement Custom CRS and Projection System from IxMaps-New (CRITICAL) - Port the SVG-to-LatLng coordinate system from ixmaps-new - Integrate custom MapConfig with proper scaling factors (MILES_TO_KM, pixels per degree) - Implement flat projection with correct prime meridian reference (30°) and equator positioning - Foundation for accurate distance measurement and map positioning 2. 📏 Add Measurement and Scale Tools (HIGH) - Port DistanceMeasurement component from ixmaps-new with click-to-measure - Add MapScale component with dynamic scale bar - Implement pixel-based distance calculations using custom projection's scale factors - Add area measurement tools for territorial calculations 3. ✏️ Integrate MapLibre-Geoman for Border Editing (HIGH) - Install @geoman-io/maplibre-geoman-free for advanced drawing/editing - Enable border modification with snapping, undo/redo, precision tools - Implement save/export to update country boundaries in database - Add validation to prevent overlapping borders 4. 🌍 Implement Dynamic Flat-to-Globe Transition (MEDIUM) - Use MapLibre's built-in globe projection - Create smooth transitions based on zoom level: - Zoom 0-3: Flat custom projection for regional view - Zoom 4+: Transition to 3D globe for global perspective - Add projection toggle button for manual control - Ensure measurements remain accurate across projections 5. 🏗️ Build World-Building Admin Tools (MEDIUM-HIGH) - Create admin interface for: - Creating new continents/landmasses - Splitting/merging territories with economic impact - Adding capitals, cities, POIs with metadata - Managing territorial claims and disputed borders - Implement versioning/history for border changes - Add import/export for custom world configurations
