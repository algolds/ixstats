## üèóÔ∏è **Core Economic Architecture**

### 1. **Primary Economic Engine** (`src/lib/calculations.ts`)

The main economic calculation system built around the `IxStatsCalculator` class:

#### **Key Components:**
- **Economic Tier Classification**: 7-tier system based on GDP per capita
- **Population Tier System**: 8-tier system based on population size
- **Growth Rate Management**: Compound annual growth with tier-specific caps
- **Global Growth Factor**: 3.21% multiplier (1.0321) applied to all economies
- **DM Input Processing**: External events affecting economic parameters

#### **Economic Tiers** (GDP Per Capita):
```typescript
IMPOVERISHED: $0-$9,999 (10% max growth)
DEVELOPING: $10,000-$24,999 (7.50% max growth)  
DEVELOPED: $25,000-$34,999 (5% max growth)
HEALTHY: $35,000-$44,999 (3.50% max growth)
STRONG: $45,000-$54,999 (2.75% max growth)
VERY_STRONG: $55,000-$64,999 (1.50% max growth)
EXTRAVAGANT: $65,000+ (0.50% max growth)
```

#### **Population Tiers**:
```typescript
TIER_1: 0-9,999,999
TIER_2: 10,000,000-29,999,999  
TIER_3: 30,000,000-49,999,999
TIER_4: 50,000,000-79,999,999
TIER_5: 80,000,000-119,999,999

```

### 2. **Enhanced Calculation Engine** (`src/lib/enhanced-calculations.ts`)

#### **Advanced Features:**
- **Logarithmic Diminishing Returns**: Prevents unrealistic growth at high GDP levels
- **Economic Cycle Modeling**: 7-year boom/bust cycles with ¬±10% variation
- **Innovation Cycle Effects**: 20-year technological progress waves
- **Volatility Factors**: Random market fluctuations based on economic stability
- **Convergence Theory**: Poorer countries grow faster (catch-up growth)
- **Compound Growth Tracking**: Year-by-year growth application for realistic patterns

#### **Growth Modifiers:**
```typescript
Population Bonuses:
- Micro countries: +15% agility bonus
- Small countries: +10% moderate bonus  
- Medium countries: +5% slight bonus
- Large countries: No modifier
- Massive countries: -5% coordination penalty

Tier Modifiers:

- Emerging: 1.2x GDP multiplier, 0.9x stability
- Developed: 1.0x baseline (reference tier)
- Advanced: 0.8x GDP multiplier, 1.1x stability, 1.3x innovation
```

### 3. **Time-Economic Integration** (`src/lib/ixtime-economic-utils.ts`)

GDP Impact: Multiplier effects (1.1 = +10%, 0.9 = -10%)
Duration: Event lifespan in years
Cascading Effects: Growth rate and inflation modifications
```

---

## üî¢ **Mathematical Models**

### **Core Growth Formula:**
```
New Value = Base Value √ó (1 + Effective Growth Rate)^Years Elapsed

Where Effective Growth Rate = 
  (Base Rate √ó Global Factor √ó Local Factor √ó Tier Modifier) 
  capped by Tier Maximum
```

### **Population Growth:**
```
New Population = Base Population √ó (1 + Population Growth Rate)^Years

With bounds: -5% to +15% annual growth (sanity checks)
Diminishing returns for populations > 500M
```

### **GDP Per Capita Growth:**
```
1. Apply global growth factor (3.21%)
2. Apply local growth factor (country-specific)
3. Apply tier modifier (based on economic development)
4. Cap at tier-specific maximum
5. Apply diminishing returns for high GDP (>$60,000)
6. Apply DM input modifications
```

### **Diminishing Returns Algorithm:**
```typescript
if (gdpPerCapita > threshold) {
  diminishingFactor = log(gdpPerCapita / threshold + 1) / log(2)
  effectiveGrowthRate /= (1 + diminishingFactor * 0.5)
}
```
