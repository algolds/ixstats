**Key Improvements:**
- Single sync event system
- Unified effectiveness scoring algorithm
- Consolidated archetype database
- Shared impact calculation logic

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

### Adapter Pattern Implementation

For services with existing imports, we provide adapter modules that redirect to the new unified services:

```typescript
// /src/app/builder/services/adapters/EconomyIntegrationAdapter.ts
export { UnifiedBuilderIntegration as EconomyIntegrationService } from '../UnifiedBuilderIntegration';
export const economyIntegrationService = new UnifiedBuilderIntegration();
```

**Adapter Files Created:**
1. `EconomyIntegrationAdapter.ts` → UnifiedBuilderIntegration
2. `CrossBuilderSynergyAdapter.ts` → UnifiedBuilderIntegration
3. `UnifiedValidationAdapter.ts` → UnifiedValidationTesting
4. `SynergyValidationAdapter.ts` → UnifiedValidationTesting
5. `GovernmentSyncAdapter.ts` → UnifiedSyncEffectiveness
6. `TaxSyncAdapter.ts` → UnifiedSyncEffectiveness
7. `RevenueTaxAdapter.ts` → UnifiedSyncEffectiveness

## Migration Guide

### Phase 1: Install New Services (Non-Breaking)
- Create 3 new unified service files
- Create adapter files for backward compatibility
- No existing code breaks

### Phase 2: Update Imports (Gradual)
Update imports gradually across the codebase:

**Before:**
```typescript
import { economyIntegrationService } from '~/app/builder/services/EconomyIntegrationService';
import { crossBuilderSynergyService } from '~/app/builder/services/CrossBuilderSynergyService';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { unifiedBuilderIntegration } from '~/app/builder/services/UnifiedBuilderIntegration';
```

### Phase 3: Deprecate Old Services
- Mark old services as deprecated with JSDoc comments
- Log warnings when old services are used
- Monitor usage metrics

### Phase 4: Remove Old Services (Future)
- After 2-3 release cycles, remove deprecated services
- Remove adapter files
- Clean up legacy code paths

## Files Affected

### New Files Created (3 core + 7 adapters = 10 files)
1. `/src/app/builder/services/UnifiedBuilderIntegration.ts`
2. `/src/app/builder/services/UnifiedValidationTesting.ts`
3. `/src/app/builder/services/UnifiedSyncEffectiveness.ts`
4-10. Adapter files in `/src/app/builder/services/adapters/`

### Files Modified (9 import locations)
1. `/src/app/builder/components/enhanced/EconomyBuilderPage.tsx`
2. `/src/app/builder/components/enhanced/AtomicBuilderPage.tsx`
3. `/src/app/builder/hooks/useBuilderState.ts`
4. `/src/app/builder/components/enhanced/economy-builder/state/useEconomyBuilderState.ts`
5. `/src/app/builder/components/enhanced/EconomyBuilderModal.tsx`
6. `/src/app/builder/services/IntegrationTestingService.ts`
7. `/src/app/builder/components/enhanced/CrossBuilderSynergyDisplay.tsx`
8. `/src/app/builder/components/enhanced/SynergyValidationDisplay.tsx`
9. `/src/components/government/atoms/RevenueSourceForm.tsx`

### Files to be Deprecated (12 services)
All 12 original service files will be marked as deprecated but remain functional via adapters.

## Benefits Analysis

### Code Reduction
- **Before:** 8,980 lines across 12 files
