# IxEconomy Integration Roadmap

## Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement (Critical)
**Priority: HIGH - Must be completed first**

### 1.1 Extend Country Model
- Add comprehensive economic data fields to Country model
- Include all economy builder sections as database columns
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing data

### 1.2 New Models for Complex Data
- `EconomicProfile` - Core economic indicators
- `LaborMarket` - Employment and workforce data
- `FiscalSystem` - Tax rates, budget, debt information
- `IncomeDistribution` - Wealth distribution and inequality data
- `GovernmentBudget` - Spending categories and allocations
- `Demographics` - Population characteristics and distribution

### 1.3 Migration Strategy
- Create migration scripts for existing countries
- Default values for new economic fields
- Data validation and constraints

## Phase 2: Component Refactoring (Critical)
**Priority: HIGH - Parallel with Phase 1**

### 2.1 Convert to Shadcn Components
- Replace custom form components with shadcn/ui
- Update styling to match IxStats theme
- Ensure accessibility and consistency

### 2.2 tRPC Integration
- Create new tRPC routes for economic data
- Update existing country routes
- Implement proper data validation

### 2.3 Component Architecture
- Move economy components to `/countries/_components/economy/`
- Create reusable economic data display components
- Implement edit/view modes

## Phase 3: Country Detail Integration (High)
**Priority: HIGH - Depends on Phases 1-2**

### 3.1 Country Detail Page Enhancement
- Add economic data tabs/sections
- Integrate economy builder components
- Maintain existing functionality

### 3.2 Data Flow Integration
- Connect economy data to country calculations
- Update IxStats calculations to use economic data
- Ensure data consistency

### 3.3 Historical Tracking
- Track changes to economic data over time
- Integration with DM inputs system
- Economic event logging

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Medium)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Post-core integration**

### 4.1 Economic Modeling
- Advanced growth calculations based on economic structure
- Sector-based economic modeling
- Regional economic effects

### 4.2 Comparative Analysis
- Country economic comparisons
- Regional economic dashboards
- Economic trend analysis

### 4.3 Economic Events System
- Integration with DM inputs for economic policies
- Economic crisis/boom modeling
- Trade agreement effects

## Phase 5: User Interface Polish (Low)
**Priority: LOW - Final polish**

### 5.1 Enhanced Visualizations
- Economic sector charts
- Wealth distribution visualizations
- Regional economic maps

### 5.2 Export/Import Features
- Economic data export to Excel
- Bulk economic data import
- Economic report generation

### 5.3 Mobile Optimization
- Responsive economic data displays
- Mobile-friendly economy builder
- Touch-optimized controls

## Implementation Order

### Week 1-2: Database Foundation
1. ✅ Update Prisma schema with economic fields
2. ✅ Create and run migrations
3. ✅ Update tRPC routes for economic data
4. ✅ Basic CRUD operations for economic data

### Week 3-4: Component Migration
1. ✅ Convert Core Economic Indicators to shadcn
2. ✅ Convert Labor & Employment to shadcn
3. ✅ Convert Fiscal System to shadcn
4. ✅ Update form validation and data flow

### Week 5-6: Integration
1. ✅ Add economic sections to country detail page
2. ✅ Connect economy builder to country system
3. ✅ Update country calculations to use economic data
4. ✅ Test end-to-end functionality

### Week 7-8: Polish & Testing
1. ✅ UI/UX improvements
2. ✅ Performance optimization
3. ✅ Comprehensive testing
4. ✅ Documentation updates

## Critical Success Factors

### Data Integrity
- Ensure no data loss during migration
- Maintain calculation accuracy
- Proper validation and constraints

### Performance
- Efficient database queries
- Optimized component rendering
- Reasonable load times for complex economic data

### User Experience
- Intuitive economic data management
- Clear data visualization
- Responsive and accessible interface

### Integration Quality
- Seamless flow between economy builder and country management
- Consistent data representation
- Reliable calculations and projections

## Risk Mitigation

### Database Migration Risks
- **Risk**: Data loss during schema changes
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup strategy, staged migrations, rollback plans

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Slow queries with expanded data model
- **Mitigation**: Database indexing, query optimization, caching strategies

### Integration Complexity
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Incremental integration, comprehensive testing, feature flags

### User Adoption
- **Risk**: Complex economic interface overwhelming users
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, helpful defaults, comprehensive documentation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Schema migration completion: 100%
- Component conversion: 100% to shadcn
- Performance: <2s load time for country detail with full economic data
- Test coverage: >90% for economic components

### User Experience Metrics
- Economic data entry completion rate
- Time to complete country economic setup
- User satisfaction with economic interface
- Error rate in economic data entry

### System Integration Metrics
- Data consistency between economy builder and country system
- Calculation accuracy with economic factors
- Successful integration with existing DM input system

## Next Steps
1. Begin with database schema updates (most critical)
2. Implement tRPC routes for economic data
3. Convert first economic component (Core Indicators) to shadcn
4. Test integration with existing country system
5. Iterate based on testing results
