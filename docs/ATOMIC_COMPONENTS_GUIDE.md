## Overview

### What are Atomic Components?

Atomic Components are the fundamental building blocks of the IxStats platform, representing modular, composable elements that combine to create complex government, economic, and tax systems. Rather than selecting from pre-defined government types or economic models, users construct custom systems by selecting individual components that interact through synergies and conflicts.

### Philosophy

The atomic component system is based on three core principles:

1. **Modularity**: Each component represents a single, well-defined concept (e.g., "Rule of Law", "Free Market System", "Digital Filing")
2. **Emergence**: Complex system behavior emerges from the interaction of simple components
3. **Flexibility**: Users can create unique combinations not possible with traditional archetypes

## Architectural Blueprint

### How Atomic Components Work

The atomic component system operates through a sophisticated state management architecture that tracks component selections, calculates interactions, and propagates changes across all systems.

### Component Structure

Every atomic component follows a standardized structure:

```typescript
interface AtomicComponent {
  // Identity
  id: string;                  // Unique identifier
  type: ComponentType;         // Component enum type
  name: string;                // Display name
  description: string;         // Detailed explanation
  category: string;            // Category (e.g., "Power Distribution")

  // Metrics
  effectiveness: number;       // Base effectiveness (0-100)
  implementationCost: number;  // One-time setup cost
  maintenanceCost: number;     // Annual operating cost
  requiredCapacity: number;    // Government capacity needed (0-100)

  // Interactions
  synergies: ComponentType[];  // Components that boost effectiveness
  conflicts: ComponentType[];  // Components that reduce effectiveness

  // Cross-Builder Integration
  governmentSynergies: string[]; // Compatible government components
  governmentConflicts: string[]; // Incompatible government components
  taxImpact: TaxImpactData;     // How this affects tax system
  sectorImpact: SectorImpacts;  // Economic sector multipliers

  // Metadata
  icon: React.Component;        // Display icon
  color: string;                // Theme color
}
```

### State Management Flow

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Composition Patterns

Components can be composed in three primary patterns:

#### 1. Layered Composition

Components build on each other in hierarchical layers:

```
Foundation Layer: Economic Model (Free Market)
    ↓
Structural Layer: Sector Focus (Technology)
    ↓
Operational Layer: Innovation (R&D Investment)
    ↓
Support Layer: Trade Policy (Free Trade)
```

#### 2. Synergistic Composition

Components intentionally selected for synergies:

```
Technocratic Process + Professional Bureaucracy + Performance Legitimacy
        ↓
Creates "Technocratic Excellence" synergy (+25% effectiveness)
```

#### 3. Balanced Composition

Components selected to balance competing priorities:

```
Free Market (efficiency) + Social Market (equity) + Green Credits (sustainability)
        ↓
Balanced system addressing multiple objectives
```

### State Persistence

Component state is persisted at multiple levels:

1. **Local State**: React hooks and context for UI reactivity
2. **Unified State Manager**: Central in-memory state with listeners
3. **Database**: Prisma ORM for long-term persistence
4. **Cache**: Redis cache for high-performance reads

## Integration Points

### Government ↔ Economy Integration

Government components directly influence economic performance through multiple channels:

#### Synergy Examples

| Government Component | Economy Component | Integration Effect |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Technocratic Process | Knowledge Economy | +18% productivity, +22% innovation |
| Professional Bureaucracy | Free Market | +12% efficiency, -5% red tape |
| Rule of Law | Finance-Centered | +15% investor confidence, +8% capital inflow |
| Democratic Process | Service-Based | +10% consumer confidence, +6% domestic consumption |

#### Conflict Examples

| Government Component | Economy Component | Integration Effect |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Autocratic Process | Free Market | -15% investment, +8% capital flight |
| Centralized Power | Gig Economy | -20% entrepreneurship, +10% regulatory burden |
| Military Administration | Innovation Economy | -18% research freedom, -12% talent attraction |

### Government ↔ Tax Integration

Government capacity and structure determine tax system effectiveness:

#### Tax Collection Efficiency

```typescript
taxCollectionEfficiency = baseRate * governmentCapacityMultiplier * componentSynergies

Example:
- Base Rate: 85%
- Professional Bureaucracy: +15%
- Rule of Law: +12%
- Digital Government: +10%
= 85% * 1.37 = 116.45% → capped at 98% realistic maximum
```

#### Optimal Tax Rates

Government components suggest optimal tax rates:

| Government Type | Optimal Corporate | Optimal Income | Optimal VAT |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Technocratic + Professional | 18-22% | 25-30% | 12-15% |
| Democratic + Rule of Law | 20-25% | 28-35% | 15-18% |
| Autocratic + Centralized | 25-30% | 30-40% | 10-12% |

### Economy ↔ Tax Integration

Economic structure determines optimal tax strategy:

#### Revenue Optimization

```typescript
optimalRevenue = (
  economicActivity *
  taxRate *
  complianceRate *
  economicComponentMultiplier
)

Knowledge Economy multiplier: 1.15
Free Market multiplier: 1.10
Manufacturing-Led multiplier: 1.05
```

#### Tax Policy Recommendations

| Economic Model | Recommended Tax Strategy | Revenue Sources |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Free Market | Low corporate (15-18%), Moderate income, Consumption-based | Corporate 30%, Income 40%, VAT 25% |
| Social Market | Moderate corporate (22-25%), Progressive income, Comprehensive | Corporate 25%, Income 50%, VAT 20% |
| Knowledge Economy | Competitive corporate (16-20%), High skill income, Digital services | Corporate 35%, Income 45%, Digital 15% |
| Resource-Based | High extraction tax, Moderate income, Export duties | Extraction 40%, Corporate 30%, Income 25% |

### Cross-Builder Synergy Detection

The system automatically detects and quantifies cross-builder synergies:

```typescript
interface CrossBuilderSynergy {
  governmentComponent: ComponentType;
  economyComponent: EconomicComponentType;
  taxComponent: TaxComponentType;
  synergyStrength: number;        // 0-100
  effectivenessBonus: number;     // Percentage boost
  description: string;
  recommendations: string[];
}

// Example detection
Detected:
  Technocratic Process (Gov) +
  Knowledge Economy (Econ) +
  R&D Tax Credits (Tax)
    ↓
Synergy: "Innovation Triad"
Strength: 95/100
Bonus: +28% unified effectiveness
```

## Component Lifecycle

### 1. Selection Phase

User selects a component from the component library.

```typescript
// User clicks on component card
function handleComponentSelect(componentType: ComponentType) {
  // Validation
  if (selectedComponents.length >= maxComponents) {
    showError("Maximum components reached");
    return;
  }

  // Check prerequisites
  const component = ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[componentType];
  const unmetPrerequisites = component.prerequisites.filter(
    prereq => !selectedComponents.includes(prereq)
  );

  if (unmetPrerequisites.length > 0) {
    showWarning(`Prerequisites needed: ${unmetPrerequisites.join(', ')}`);
    return;
  }

  // Add component
  setSelectedComponents([...selectedComponents, componentType]);
}
```

### 2. Validation Phase

System validates the new component selection.

```typescript
function validateComponentSelection(components: ComponentType[]) {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  const warnings: string[] = [];

  // Check for conflicts
  components.forEach(comp1 => {
    components.forEach(comp2 => {
      if (comp1 !== comp2) {
        const component1 = ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[comp1];
        if (component1?.conflicts.includes(comp2)) {
          errors.push(
            `Conflict: ${component1.name} conflicts with ${ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[comp2]?.name}`
          );
        }
      }
    });
  });

  // Check capacity requirements
  const totalCapacity = components.reduce(
    (sum, comp) => sum + (ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[comp]?.requiredCapacity || 0),
    0
  );

  if (totalCapacity > 100) {
    warnings.push(`Total capacity requirement (${totalCapacity}) exceeds 100`);
  }

  // Check costs
  const totalCost = components.reduce(
    (sum, comp) => sum + (ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[comp]?.maintenanceCost || 0),
    0
  );

  if (totalCost > totalBudget) {
    errors.push(`Annual costs ($${totalCost}) exceed budget ($${totalBudget})`);
  }

  return { errors, warnings, isValid: errors.length === 0 };
}
```

### 3. Calculation Phase

System calculates effectiveness, synergies, and impacts.

```typescript
function calculateComponentEffectiveness(components: ComponentType[]) {
  // Base effectiveness (average of all components)
  const baseEffectiveness = components.reduce(
    (sum, comp) => sum + (ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[comp]?.effectiveness || 0),
    0
  ) / (components.length || 1);

  // Calculate synergy bonuses
  let synergyBonus = 0;
  let synergyCount = 0;

  components.forEach(comp1 => {
    components.forEach(comp2 => {
      if (comp1 !== comp2) {
        const component1 = ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[comp1];
        if (component1?.synergies.includes(comp2)) {
          synergyBonus += 10; // Each synergy adds 10 points
          synergyCount++;
        }
      }
    });
  });

  // Calculate conflict penalties
  let conflictPenalty = 0;
  let conflictCount = 0;

  components.forEach(comp1 => {
    components.forEach(comp2 => {
      if (comp1 !== comp2) {
        const component1 = ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[comp1];
        if (component1?.conflicts.includes(comp2)) {
          conflictPenalty += 15; // Each conflict subtracts 15 points
          conflictCount++;
        }
      }
    });
  });

  // Country context modifier
  const contextMultiplier = getCountryContextMultiplier();

  // Final effectiveness
  const totalEffectiveness = Math.max(0, Math.min(100,
    (baseEffectiveness + synergyBonus - conflictPenalty) * contextMultiplier
  ));

  return {
    baseEffectiveness,
    synergyBonus,
    synergyCount,
    conflictPenalty,
    conflictCount,
    totalEffectiveness
  };
}
```

### 4. Propagation Phase

Changes propagate through the unified state manager.

```typescript
class UnifiedAtomicStateManager {
  setSelectedComponents(components: ComponentType[]) {
    // Update core state
    this.state.selectedComponents = components;

    // Trigger cascade calculations
    this.calculateEffectiveness();
    this.calculateSynergiesAndConflicts();
    this.calculateEconomicIntegration();
    this.calculateTaxIntegration();
    this.generateGovernmentStructure();
    this.generateIntelligenceFeeds();
    this.updateRealTimeMetrics();
    this.updatePerformanceAnalytics();

    // Notify all listeners
    this.notifyListeners();
  }

  private notifyListeners() {
    this.listeners.forEach(listener => {
      listener(this.state);
    });
  }
}
```

### 5. Rendering Phase

UI components receive updates and re-render.

```typescript
function ComponentEffectivenessDisplay() {
  const [state, setState] = useState<UnifiedAtomicState | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to state manager
    const manager = getUnifiedStateManager();
    const unsubscribe = manager.subscribe((newState) => {
      setState(newState);
    });

    // Initial state
    setState(manager.getState());

    // Cleanup
    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);

  if (!state) return <LoadingSpinner />;

  return (
    <div className="effectiveness-display">
      <MetricCard
        title="System Effectiveness"
        value={`${state.effectivenessScore.toFixed(0)}%`}
        trend={state.effectivenessScore >= 80 ? 'up' : 'down'}
      />
      <MetricCard
        title="Active Synergies"
        value={state.synergies.length}
        color="green"
      />
      <MetricCard
        title="Conflicts"
        value={state.conflicts.length}
        color={state.conflicts.length > 0 ? 'red' : 'gray'}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Creating New Components

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Define Component Type

Add your component to the appropriate enum:

```typescript
// For government components: src/types/government.ts
export enum ComponentType {
  // ... existing components
  NEW_COMPONENT = "NEW_COMPONENT"
}

// For economy components: src/components/economy/atoms/AtomicEconomicComponents.tsx
export enum EconomicComponentType {
  // ... existing components
  NEW_ECONOMIC_COMPONENT = "NEW_ECONOMIC_COMPONENT"
}

// For tax components: src/components/tax-system/atoms/AtomicTaxComponents.tsx
// Add to ATOMIC_TAX_COMPONENTS constant
```

#### Step 2: Create Component Definition

**Government Component Example:**

```typescript
// src/components/government/atoms/AtomicGovernmentComponents.tsx

[ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT]: {
  id: 'new_component',
  type: ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT,
  name: 'New Component',
  description: 'Detailed description of what this component does',
  effectiveness: 82,
  synergies: [
    ComponentType.COMPLEMENTARY_COMPONENT,
    ComponentType.ANOTHER_SYNERGY
  ],
  conflicts: [
    ComponentType.INCOMPATIBLE_COMPONENT
  ],
  implementationCost: 100000,
  maintenanceCost: 50000,
  requiredCapacity: 75
}
```

**Economy Component Example:**

```typescript
// src/components/economy/atoms/AtomicEconomicComponents.tsx

[EconomicComponentType.NEW_ECONOMIC_COMPONENT]: {
  id: 'new_economic_component',
  type: EconomicComponentType.NEW_ECONOMIC_COMPONENT,
  name: 'New Economic Component',
  description: 'Description of economic component',
  effectiveness: 85,
  synergies: [
    EconomicComponentType.SYNERGY_COMPONENT
  ],
  conflicts: [
    EconomicComponentType.CONFLICT_COMPONENT
  ],
  governmentSynergies: ['GOVERNMENT_COMPONENT'],
  governmentConflicts: ['INCOMPATIBLE_GOV'],
  taxImpact: {
    optimalCorporateRate: 20,
    optimalIncomeRate: 28,
    revenueEfficiency: 0.85
  },
  sectorImpact: {
    'technology': 1.5,
    'finance': 1.3,
    'manufacturing': 1.1
  },
  employmentImpact: {
    unemploymentModifier: -1.0,
    participationModifier: 1.2,
    wageGrowthModifier: 1.3
  },
  implementationCost: 150000,
  maintenanceCost: 70000,
  requiredCapacity: 80,
  category: EconomicCategory.ECONOMIC_MODEL,
  icon: Zap,
  color: 'blue'
}
```

**Tax Component Example:**

```typescript
// src/components/tax-system/atoms/AtomicTaxComponents.tsx

new_tax_component: {
  id: 'new_tax_component',
  name: 'New Tax Component',
  category: 'Collection Methods',
  description: 'Description of tax component functionality',
  implementationCost: 120000,
  maintenanceCost: 55000,
  effectiveness: 87,
  prerequisites: ['digital_filing'], // Must have this first
  synergies: ['related_component', 'another_synergy'],
  conflicts: ['incompatible_component'],
  impactsOn: ['collectionEfficiency', 'complianceRate'],
  metadata: {
    complexity: 'Medium',
    timeToImplement: '15 months',
    staffRequired: 30,
    technologyRequired: true
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Add to Category

Ensure your component is in the appropriate category:

```typescript
// src/components/government/atoms/AtomicGovernmentComponents.tsx
export const COMPONENT_CATEGORIES = {
  powerDistribution: [
    // ... existing
    ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT // Add here if power distribution
  ],
  // ... other categories
};
```

#### Step 4: Define Synergies and Conflicts

Add synergy and conflict rules if they involve calculations:

```typescript
// src/lib/atomic-builder-state.ts
export const SYNERGY_RULES = [
  // ... existing rules
  {
    id: 'new-synergy',
    components: [ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT, ComponentType.SYNERGY_PARTNER],
    modifier: 1.15, // 15% boost
    description: 'New component synergizes with partner component'
  }
];

export const CONFLICT_RULES = [
  // ... existing rules
  {
    id: 'new-conflict',
    components: [ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT, ComponentType.CONFLICT_PARTNER],
    penalty: 0.10, // 10% penalty
    description: 'New component conflicts with incompatible component'
  }
];
```

#### Step 5: Update Effectiveness Calculations

Add component-specific impact calculations:

```typescript
// src/lib/unified-atomic-state.ts
private calculateComponentEconomicImpact(component: ComponentType): number {
  const impacts: Record<ComponentType, number> = {
    // ... existing impacts
    [ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT]: 0.12, // 12% economic boost
  };
  return impacts[component] || 0.05;
}

private calculateComponentTaxImpact(component: ComponentType): number {
  const impacts: Record<ComponentType, number> = {
    // ... existing impacts
    [ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT]: 0.18, // 18% tax efficiency boost
  };
  return impacts[component] || 0.03;
}

private calculateComponentStructureImpact(component: ComponentType): string[] {
  const impacts: Record<ComponentType, string[]> = {
    // ... existing impacts
    [ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT]: [
      'New Department Created',
      'Additional Regulatory Body'
    ],
  };
  return impacts[component] || [];
}
```

#### Step 6: Update Database Schema (if needed)

If adding new enum values:

```bash
# Add to prisma/schema.prisma (currently 131 models, 9 migrations)
enum ComponentType {
  // ... existing values
  NEW_COMPONENT
}

# Generate migration
npm run prisma:migrate dev --name add_new_component

# Regenerate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate
```

**Note**: The atomic integration migration (20251017203807_add_atomic_integration) added comprehensive support for atomic components across government, economic, and tax systems.

#### Step 7: Add Tests

```typescript
// src/tests/components/new-component.test.ts
describe('New Component', () => {
  it('should have correct effectiveness', () => {
    const component = ATOMIC_COMPONENTS[ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT];
    expect(component.effectiveness).toBe(82);
  });

  it('should create synergy with partner', () => {
    const components = [
      ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT,
      ComponentType.SYNERGY_PARTNER
    ];
    const { synergyCount } = calculateComponentEffectiveness(components);
    expect(synergyCount).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });

  it('should conflict with incompatible component', () => {
    const components = [
      ComponentType.NEW_COMPONENT,
      ComponentType.CONFLICT_PARTNER
    ];
    const { conflictCount } = calculateComponentEffectiveness(components);
    expect(conflictCount).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

#### Step 8: Update Documentation

Add your component to this guide's Component Inventory section.

## Synergy & Conflict System

### How Synergies Work

Synergies occur when two or more components work particularly well together, creating a boost in effectiveness beyond their individual contributions.

#### Synergy Detection

```typescript
function detectSynergies(selectedComponents: ComponentType[]): Synergy[] {
  const activeSynergies: Synergy[] = [];

  SYNERGY_RULES.forEach(rule => {
    // Check if all required components are present
    const hasAllComponents = rule.components.every(
      comp => selectedComponents.includes(comp)
    );

    if (hasAllComponents) {
      activeSynergies.push({
        id: rule.id,
        components: rule.components,
        modifier: rule.modifier,
        description: rule.description
      });
    }
  });

  return activeSynergies;
}
```

#### Synergy Types

**1. Complementary Synergies**

Components that complement each other's functions:

- **Professional Bureaucracy + Performance Legitimacy**
  - Modifier: 1.18 (18% boost)
  - Reason: Merit-based bureaucracy reinforces performance-based legitimacy

**2. Reinforcing Synergies**

Components that strengthen the same objective:

- **Technocratic Process + Technocratic Agencies + R&D Investment**
  - Modifier: 1.25 (25% boost)
  - Reason: All focus on expertise and innovation

**3. Multiplier Synergies**

One component multiplies the effect of another:

- **Digital Filing + Automated Verification + Integrated Systems**
  - Modifier: 1.30 (30% boost)
  - Reason: Digital infrastructure enables powerful automation

#### Synergy Calculation

```typescript
function applySynergyBonuses(
  baseEffectiveness: number,
  synergies: Synergy[]
): number {
  // Each synergy adds a bonus
  const synergyBonus = synergies.reduce((sum, synergy) => {
    return sum + ((synergy.modifier - 1) * 100);
  }, 0);

  // Apply bonus to base effectiveness
  return baseEffectiveness + synergyBonus;
}

// Example:
// Base: 75%
// Synergy 1: +15%
// Synergy 2: +10%
// Result: 75% + 15% + 10% = 100%
```

### How Conflicts Work

Conflicts occur when components work at cross-purposes, reducing overall effectiveness.

#### Conflict Detection

```typescript
function detectConflicts(selectedComponents: ComponentType[]): Conflict[] {
  const activeConflicts: Conflict[] = [];

  CONFLICT_RULES.forEach(rule => {
    // Check if all conflicting components are present
    const hasAllComponents = rule.components.every(
      comp => selectedComponents.includes(comp)
    );

    if (hasAllComponents) {
      activeConflicts.push({
        id: rule.id,
        components: rule.components,
        penalty: rule.penalty,
        description: rule.description
      });
    }
  });

  return activeConflicts;
}
```

#### Conflict Types

**1. Ideological Conflicts**

Components representing opposing philosophies:

- **Autocratic Process + Democratic Process**
  - Penalty: -20%
  - Reason: Fundamentally incompatible decision-making approaches

**2. Operational Conflicts**

Components that interfere with each other's operation:

- **Centralized Power + Federal System**
  - Penalty: -15%
  - Reason: Competing authority structures

**3. Resource Conflicts**

Components that compete for the same resources:

- **Professional Bureaucracy + Partisan Institutions**
  - Penalty: -18%
  - Reason: Competing for government positions and influence

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies

Users can resolve conflicts through:

1. **Component Removal**: Remove one of the conflicting components
2. **Mediator Selection**: Add components that bridge the conflict
3. **Sequential Implementation**: Implement components at different times
4. **Isolation**: Keep components in separate domains

### Examples

#### Positive Synergy Chain

```
Selection:
├─ Knowledge Economy (effectiveness: 88%)
├─ Technology-Focused (effectiveness: 92%)
├─ R&D Investment (effectiveness: 90%)
└─ University Partnerships (effectiveness: 86%)

Detected Synergies:
├─ "Innovation Ecosystem" (Knowledge + Tech + R&D): +25%
├─ "Academic-Industry Bridge" (Tech + University): +12%
└─ "Research Excellence" (R&D + University): +15%

Calculation:
Base Effectiveness: (88 + 92 + 90 + 86) / 4 = 89%
Synergy Bonuses: 25 + 12 + 15 = +52%
Total Effectiveness: 89% + 52% = 141% → capped at 100%
```

#### Conflict Scenario

```
Selection:
├─ Free Market System (effectiveness: 85%)
├─ Planned Economy (effectiveness: 65%)
├─ State Capitalism (effectiveness: 72%)

Detected Conflicts:
├─ "Economic Philosophy Clash" (Free Market + Planned): -25%
└─ "Market Structure Confusion" (Free Market + State): -15%

Calculation:
Base Effectiveness: (85 + 65 + 72) / 3 = 74%
Conflict Penalties: -25 + -15 = -40%
Total Effectiveness: 74% - 40% = 34%

Warning: "Severe conflicts detected. Consider removing incompatible components."
```

---

## Effectiveness Calculations

### Base Effectiveness Formula

```typescript
baseEffectiveness = sum(componentEffectiveness) / numberOfComponents
```

### Synergy Bonus Formula

```typescript
synergyBonus = sum((synergyModifier - 1) * 100) for each active synergy
```

### Conflict Penalty Formula

```typescript
conflictPenalty = sum(conflictPenalty * 100) for each active conflict
```

### Context Multiplier Formula

```typescript
contextMultiplier =
  sizeMultiplier *
  developmentMultiplier *
  traditionMultiplier

Where:
  sizeMultiplier = {
    small: 1.1,
    medium: 1.0,
    large: 0.95
  }

  developmentMultiplier = {
    developing: 0.9,

### Total Effectiveness Formula

```typescript
totalEffectiveness = Math.max(0, Math.min(100,
  (baseEffectiveness + synergyBonus - conflictPenalty) * contextMultiplier
))
```

### Unified Effectiveness (Cross-Builder)

When integrating government, economy, and tax systems:

```typescript
unifiedEffectiveness = (
  governmentEffectiveness * 0.35 +
  economyEffectiveness * 0.40 +
  taxEffectiveness * 0.25
) * crossBuilderSynergyMultiplier
```

### Economic Impact Formula

```typescript
economicImpact = {
  gdpGrowth: baseGDPGrowth * (1 + sum(componentGDPModifiers)),
  employment: baseEmployment * (1 + sum(componentEmploymentModifiers)),
  productivity: baseProductivity * (1 + sum(componentProductivityModifiers))
}
```

### Tax Revenue Formula

```typescript
taxRevenue = (
  taxableBase *
  taxRate *
  complianceRate *
  collectionEfficiency *
  economicComponentMultiplier *
  governmentComponentMultiplier
)
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: High-Performing System

```
Components:
- Technocratic Process (85%)
- Professional Bureaucracy (88%)
- Performance Legitimacy (85%)
- Rule of Law (92%)

Base Effectiveness: (85 + 88 + 85 + 92) / 4 = 87.5%
Synergies: +18% (Technocratic + Professional) + 15% (Performance + Professional) = +33%
Conflicts: None
Context: Medium developed country = 1.05x
Total: (87.5% + 33%) * 1.05 = 126.5% → capped at 100%
```

#### Example 2: Conflicted System

```
Components:
- Democratic Process (75%)
- Autocratic Process (88%)
- Electoral Legitimacy (80%)

Base Effectiveness: (75 + 88 + 80) / 3 = 81%
Synergies: None
Conflicts: -20% (Democratic vs Autocratic)
Context: Medium mixed country = 1.0x
Total: (81% - 20%) * 1.0 = 61%
```

## Best Practices

### Component Selection

1. **Start with Foundation**: Choose economic model and power distribution first
2. **Build Synergies**: Look for components that create synergies with existing selections
3. **Avoid Conflicts**: Check conflict indicators before adding incompatible components
4. **Balance Costs**: Monitor total implementation and maintenance costs
5. **Consider Capacity**: Ensure total required capacity doesn't exceed 100

### Composition Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Technocratic Excellence

```
Core:
- Technocratic Process
- Professional Bureaucracy
- Performance Legitimacy

Support:
- Technocratic Agencies
- Rule of Law
- Digital Government

Result: 95%+ effectiveness, high innovation, efficient administration
```

#### Pattern 2: Democratic Stability

```
Core:
- Democratic Process
- Electoral Legitimacy
- Rule of Law

Support:
- Independent Judiciary
- Federal System
- Professional Bureaucracy

Result: 85%+ effectiveness, high legitimacy, strong institutions
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Low Effectiveness Despite Many Components

**Symptoms**: Selected many components but effectiveness score is below 70%.

**Causes**:
- Multiple conflicts present
- Incompatible components selected
- Poor synergy coverage

**Solutions**:
1. Check conflict list and remove one component from each conflict
2. Replace conflicting components with compatible alternatives
3. Add components that create synergies with existing selections

**Example Fix**:
```
Before:
- Free Market (85%) + Planned Economy (65%) = CONFLICT (-25%)
- Total: 60%

After:
- Free Market (85%) + Mixed Economy (78%) = SYNERGY (+12%)
- Total: 88%
```

#### Issue 2: Prerequisites Not Met

**Symptoms**: Cannot select a desired component, grayed out in UI.

**Causes**:
- Component has prerequisites that haven't been selected

**Solutions**:
1. Check component details for prerequisites
2. Select prerequisite components first
3. Add prerequisites in correct order

**Example Fix**:
```
Cannot select: Blockchain Ledger
Reason: Requires "Digital Filing" and "Real-Time Reporting"

Solution:
1. Select Digital Filing (prerequisite)
2. Select Real-Time Reporting (prerequisite)
3. Now Blockchain Ledger is available
```

#### Issue 3: Budget Exceeded

**Symptoms**: Total annual costs exceed allocated budget.

**Causes**:
- Too many high-cost components selected
- Insufficient budget allocation

**Solutions**:
1. Remove highest-cost components with lower effectiveness
2. Replace expensive components with lower-cost alternatives
3. Increase total budget if possible
4. Phase implementation over multiple years

**Example Fix**:
```
Budget: $500,000/year
Current Costs: $620,000/year
Overage: $120,000

Remove: Advanced Analytics ($90,000) → Replace with: Simplified Analytics ($40,000)
Remove: Blockchain Ledger ($100,000) → Replace with: Standard Database ($30,000)

New Costs: $490,000/year ✓
```

#### Issue 4: Capacity Overload

**Symptoms**: Total required capacity exceeds 100.

**Causes**:
- Too many high-capacity components
- Government lacks institutional capacity

**Solutions**:
1. Remove most capacity-intensive components
2. Implement components in phases
3. Build capacity gradually over time
4. Focus on efficiency components first

**Example Fix**:
```
Total Capacity Required: 135
Available Capacity: 100
Overload: +35

Phase 1 (Capacity: 65):
- Digital Filing (50)
- Simplified Filing (15)

Phase 2 (Capacity: 85):
- Add Real-Time Reporting (20)

Phase 3 (Capacity: 100):
- Add Advanced Analytics (15)
```

#### Issue 5: Cross-Builder Conflicts

**Symptoms**: Components work individually but create conflicts when integrated across builders.

**Causes**:
- Incompatible government and economic models
- Tax strategy doesn't align with economic structure
- Implementation timing issues

**Solutions**:
1. Review cross-builder compatibility matrices
2. Align government type with economic model
3. Coordinate implementation phases
4. Add mediator components to bridge conflicts

**Example Fix**:
```
Conflict: Autocratic Process (Gov) + Free Market (Econ)
Impact: -15% unified effectiveness

Solution Option 1: Change to Technocratic Process (Gov)
Solution Option 2: Change to State Capitalism (Econ)
Solution Option 3: Add Economic Incentives (Gov) as mediator

Selected: Option 1
Result: +18% synergy instead of -15% conflict
```
