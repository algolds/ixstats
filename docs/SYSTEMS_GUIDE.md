## Overview

IxStats is a comprehensive nation simulation and worldbuilding platform featuring advanced economic modeling, diplomatic systems, intelligence operations, and social collaboration tools. The platform combines sophisticated mathematical models with engaging gameplay mechanics for tabletop RPG campaigns, alternate history scenarios, and strategic simulation.

### Core Philosophy

**"Government as Chemistry"** - Just like chemical elements combine to form compounds with unique properties, government components combine to create governance systems with emergent characteristics that couldn't be predicted from individual parts alone.

## Atomic Government System

### Architecture Overview

The Atomic Government System is a revolutionary approach where governments are built from fundamental "atomic" components that interact to create emergent behaviors and effectiveness levels.

#### 24 Atomic Components (5 Categories)

**1. Power Distribution**
- `CENTRALIZED_POWER` - Strong central authority (85% effectiveness)
- `FEDERAL_SYSTEM` - Distributed regional power (75% effectiveness)
- `CONFEDERATE_SYSTEM` - Weak central government (65% effectiveness)
- `UNITARY_SYSTEM` - Unified national administration (80% effectiveness)

**2. Decision Processes**
- `DEMOCRATIC_PROCESS` - Popular representation (70% effectiveness, +15 legitimacy)
- `AUTOCRATIC_PROCESS` - Single authority rule (90% effectiveness, +25 speed)
- `TECHNOCRATIC_PROCESS` - Expert-based decisions (85% effectiveness, +20 innovation)
- `CONSENSUS_PROCESS` - Group agreement required (60% effectiveness, +30 stability)
- `OLIGARCHIC_PROCESS` - Small group control

**3. Legitimacy Sources**
- `ELECTORAL_LEGITIMACY` - Democratic mandate (+20 stability, +15 international relations)
- `TRADITIONAL_LEGITIMACY` - Historical authority (+25 stability, +20 cultural unity)
- `PERFORMANCE_LEGITIMACY` - Results-based acceptance (+15 economic bonus)
- `CHARISMATIC_LEGITIMACY` - Leader-based authority (+30 mobilization, +20 volatility)
- `RELIGIOUS_LEGITIMACY` - Spiritual foundation

**4. Institutions**
- `PROFESSIONAL_BUREAUCRACY` - Merit-based civil service (85% effectiveness)
- `MILITARY_ADMINISTRATION` - Armed forces control
- `INDEPENDENT_JUDICIARY` - Separate court system
- `PARTISAN_INSTITUTIONS` - Political party control
- `TECHNOCRATIC_AGENCIES` - Expert-led departments

**5. Control Mechanisms**
- `RULE_OF_LAW` - Legal system supremacy (85% effectiveness)
- `SURVEILLANCE_SYSTEM` - Monitoring apparatus (78% effectiveness)
- `ECONOMIC_INCENTIVES` - Market-based compliance
- `SOCIAL_PRESSURE` - Community enforcement
- `MILITARY_ENFORCEMENT` - Force-based control

### Synergies & Conflicts

#### Major Synergies
```typescript
TECHNOCRATIC_PROCESS + PROFESSIONAL_BUREAUCRACY = {
  economicBonus: +15%,
  taxBonus: +20%,
  description: "Optimal policy implementation"
}

RULE_OF_LAW + INDEPENDENT_JUDICIARY = {
  economicBonus: +12%,
  stabilityBonus: +15,
  description: "Strong institutional framework"
}
```

#### Critical Conflicts
```typescript
DEMOCRATIC_PROCESS + SURVEILLANCE_SYSTEM = {
  economicPenalty: -10%,
  stabilityPenalty: -8,
  description: "Democratic backsliding risk"
}
```

### Government Effectiveness Formula

```javascript
Government_Effectiveness = Base_Score + Σ(Component_Scores * Weights) + Synergy_Bonus - Conflict_Penalty

Where:
- Base_Score = 50
- Component_Score = Component_Effectiveness * 0.2
- Synergy_Bonus = 5 * Number_of_Synergies
- Conflict_Penalty = 8 * Number_of_Conflicts
```

### Economic Integration

Atomic components directly influence economic performance:
- **GDP Growth Modifier**: 1.0x to 1.3x multiplier
- **Tax Collection Efficiency**: 0.8x to 1.4x multiplier
- **International Trade Bonus**: 0 to +25 points
- **Innovation Multiplier**: 1.0x to 1.5x factor

### Implementation Files

- `src/components/atomic/AtomicStateProvider.tsx` - React context provider
- `src/lib/atomic-client-calculations.ts` - Client-safe calculation functions

## Economic Systems

### Tier-Based Growth System

#### Economic Tiers (GDP Per Capita)
- **IMPOVERISHED**: $0-$9,999 (10% max growth)
- **DEVELOPING**: $10,000-$24,999 (7.50% max growth)
- **DEVELOPED**: $25,000-$34,999 (5% max growth)
- **HEALTHY**: $35,000-$44,999 (3.50% max growth)
- **STRONG**: $45,000-$54,999 (2.75% max growth)
- **VERY_STRONG**: $55,000-$64,999 (1.50% max growth)
- **EXTRAVAGANT**: $65,000+ (0.50% max growth)

#### Population Tiers
- **TIER_1**: 0-9.9M people
- **TIER_2**: 10-29.9M people

- **TIER_7**: 350-499.9M people
- **TIER_X**: 500M+ people

### Core Economic Formulas

#### Growth Rate Calculation
```javascript
New Value = Base Value × (1 + Effective Growth Rate)^Years Elapsed

Where Effective Growth Rate =
  (Base Rate × Global Factor × Local Factor × Tier Modifier)
  capped by Tier Maximum
```

#### Diminishing Returns Algorithm
```typescript
if (gdpPerCapita > threshold) {
  diminishingFactor = log(gdpPerCapita / threshold + 1) / log(2)
  effectiveGrowthRate /= (1 + diminishingFactor * 0.5)
}
```

2. **Update Database Schema**: Modify `prisma/schema.prisma`
3. **Implement Calculations**: Add to appropriate `lib/` files
4. **Create API Endpoints**: Use tRPC patterns in `src/server/api/routers/`
5. **Build UI Components**: Follow glass physics design system

### Testing Economic Models

- Use `enhanced-calculations.ts` for sophisticated scenarios
- Validate against historical data when possible
- Test extreme values and edge cases
- Verify tier transitions function correctly

### Performance Optimization

- Use `React.memo` for pure components
- Implement `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers
- Virtualize long lists
- Lazy load heavy components
