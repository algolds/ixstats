# IxStats Production CRUD Operations Audit

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE
**Environment:** Production

## Overview
This document audits all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations across the IxStats platform to ensure proper functionality in production.

## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Database Permissions ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Production database (`prod.db`) had read-only permissions (644)
- **Impact:** All write operations (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) were failing silently
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Changed permissions to 664 (read-write for owner and group)
  - Created WAL files with proper permissions
  - Ensured prisma directory has write permissions (775)
  - Added DATABASE_URL to PM2 environment config

### 2. User Auto-Creation ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Clerk-authenticated users not being created in database
- **Impact:** Users couldn't perform any operations requiring user context
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Added automatic user creation in tRPC context
  - Auto-assigns default "user" role on first authentication
  - Logs user creation for audit trail

### 3. Clerk Authentication Configuration ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Incorrect redirect URLs causing session inconsistency
- **Impact:** Users randomly signed out after refresh
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Updated ClerkProvider with absolute URLs for production
  - Set proper fallback redirect URLs
  - Updated .env.production with correct paths

### 4. Error Logging System ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue:** No comprehensive error logging in production
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Created ErrorLogger service with SystemLog integration
  - Added automatic error logging to tRPC error formatter
  - Supports Discord webhook notifications
  - Logs all errors to database for audit trail
