# Country Builder Integration Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the comprehensive integration of existing robust component functionality (Demographics.tsx, FiscalSystem.tsx, etc.) with the sophisticated glass physics design system and enhanced builder architecture. The goal is to create an intuitive, natural, and standardized experience that leverages the best of both worlds.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ **Strengths - What's Working Well**

#### Enhanced Architecture (BuilderPageEnhanced.tsx, EconomicCustomizationHub.tsx)
- **3-Phase Flow**: Select → Customize → Preview provides excellent user journey
- **Glass Physics Design System**: Hierarchical depth system with theme integration
- **Modular Primitives**: Well-structured atomic components (SectionNavigator, PolicyAdvisor, etc.)
- **Section-Based Navigation**: Clean organization of economic customization areas
- **Live Feedback**: Real-time validation and economic health monitoring
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo patterns and error boundaries

#### Robust Component Functionality (Demographics.tsx, FiscalSystem.tsx, LaborEmployment.tsx)
- **Comprehensive Data Models**: Detailed economic, demographic, and fiscal modeling
- **Complex Interactions**: Advanced controls for tax rates, spending categories, age distributions
- **Data Validation**: Real-time calculations and constraint checking
- **Rich Visualizations**: Charts, sliders, and interactive controls
- **Business Logic**: Sophisticated economic relationships and calculations

### ⚠️ **Challenges - What Needs Integration**

#### Design System Inconsistencies
- **Old Components**: Use CSS variables (`var(--color-text-primary)`) and basic styling
- **New Components**: Use glass physics system with depth/blur/theme properties
- **Input Controls**: Inconsistent slider/knob styling between old and new components
- **Layout Patterns**: Grid layouts vs. glass card hierarchies

#### User Experience Fragmentation
- **BuilderHub.tsx**: Simple grid layout feels basic compared to EconomicCustomizationHub
- **Navigation**: Old components lack the section-based navigation of enhanced flow
- **Basic/Advanced Views**: Not properly implemented in old components
- **Content Hierarchy**: Inconsistent information organization

#### Technical Architecture Gaps
- **Component Integration**: Old components not designed for glass system integration
- **Props Interface**: Inconsistent prop patterns between old and new components
- **State Management**: Different patterns for handling economic data updates
- **Type Safety**: Some old components have looser TypeScript integration

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Unification 🏗️

#### 1.1 Standardized Design Language
```typescript
// Unified Glass Component Pattern
interface StandardSectionProps {
  showAdvanced: boolean;
  theme: 'gold' | 'blue' | 'indigo' | 'red' | 'neutral';
  depth: 'base' | 'elevated' | 'modal' | 'interactive';
  inputs: EconomicInputs;
  onInputsChange: (inputs: EconomicInputs) => void;
}
```

#### 1.2 Standardized Input Controls
- **Glass Sliders**: Unified slider components with glass physics
- **Glass Number Inputs**: Consistent numeric input styling
- **Glass Toggle Switches**: Basic/Advanced mode toggles
- **Glass Progress Indicators**: Health meters and completion bars

#### 1.3 Content Hierarchy Framework
```
Glass Section Card
├── Glass Header (with Basic/Advanced toggle)
├── Glass Content
│   ├── Overview Metrics (always visible)
│   ├── Basic Controls (simplified interface)
│   └── Advanced Controls (progressive disclosure)
└── Glass Footer (validation/tips)
```

### Phase 2: Component Migration 🔄

#### 2.1 Demographics Component Refactor
**Target**: `src/app/builder/sections/DemographicsSection.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Wrap in `GlassCard` with appropriate depth/theme
- Replace CSS variables with glass theme system
- Implement proper Basic/Advanced view splitting:
  - **Basic**: Total population, life expectancy, literacy rate, urban/rural split
  - **Advanced**: Age distributions, regional breakdown, education levels, citizenship
- Standardize slider components using glass design
- Add proper section header with toggle

**Migration Pattern**:
```typescript
// Before: Old CSS variable styling
<div className="bg-[var(--color-bg-secondary)] rounded-lg border border-[var(--color-border-primary)]">

// After: Glass physics styling
<GlassCard depth="elevated" blur="medium" theme="neutral">
  <GlassCardContent>
```

#### 2.2 Fiscal System Component Refactor
**Target**: `src/app/builder/sections/FiscalSystemSection.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Implement glass design system throughout
- Enhance the revenue/spending/debt view switcher with glass aesthetics
- Create standardized tax rate controls with glass sliders
- Improve spending category visualization with glass progress indicators
- Add comprehensive Basic/Advanced view splitting:
  - **Basic**: Overall tax revenue %, government spending %, deficit/surplus
  - **Advanced**: Detailed tax rates, spending by category, debt management

#### 2.3 Labor Employment Component Refactor
**Target**: `src/app/builder/sections/LaborEmploymentSection.tsx`

**Changes** (Partial - already uses some modern components):
- Replace shadcn Card with GlassCard
- Standardize input controls with glass design
- Enhance progress indicators with glass styling
- Implement proper Basic/Advanced splitting:
  - **Basic**: Unemployment rate, labor force participation, average income
  - **Advanced**: Workweek hours, minimum wage, workforce demographics

### Phase 3: Enhanced Integration 🚀
