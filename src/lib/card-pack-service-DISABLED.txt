DISABLED FUNCTIONS - UserPack, UserVault, TradingCard models removed from schema

The following functions from card-pack-service.ts have been disabled because
they depend on database models that no longer exist:

1. purchasePack() - uses UserPack, UserVault
2. openPack() - uses UserPack, TradingCard
3. getUserPacks() - uses UserPack
4. getAvailablePacks() - uses pack fields that don't exist

These functions can be restored when the models are added back to the schema.
