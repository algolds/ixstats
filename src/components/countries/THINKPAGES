'''Thinkpages''' is an online {{wp|social media}} and {{wp|social networking service}} owned by Caphirian-based technology company [[Valtari]]. Created in [[Hollona and Diorisia]] in 2002 by military engineer Marcos Perle as a blog with social characteristics, the platform gradually transitioned from blog services to full social media interactivity. Until its IPO in 2011, membership was exclusively limited to the [[Levantine Union]].  However, after Thinkpages went public the company quickly expanded to over 50 countries and became a dominant social media platform, with over 700 million registered users by 2020. In 2022, Thinkpages was acquired by [[Valtari]], for $37.2 billion. As of 2030, Thinkpages claimed 4.22 billion monthly users. 

Thinkpages can be accessed from devices with internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Thinkshare messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Thinkpages friends and the pages they follow.

Thinkpages has been ran by founder Marcos Perle since its inception, and since the acquisition he has had the title Executive of Thinkpages. 

==History==
Thinkpages was conceived of by Marcos Perle, an engineer attached to [[Levantine Union]] defense forces on the [[Vandarch]], in early 2002. Perle envisioned the space primarily as a blog for general thoughts mainly targeted at individuals on military bases throughout the Levantine Union, and with the blog features he included a primitive social networking component in order for military personnel to meet each other online, allowing the posting of photos, life events, and real names. Launched in July 2002, the service was successful in Vandarch area military postings, and began to spread throughout northern [[Dericania]] by early 2003 as personnel using the service were deployed to other regional bases. Civilian use of the platform is believed to have begun around this time, as users of the platform would return home following the end of a military tour. A military email was originally required to create an account, but it was opened to all residents of the Deric States by early 2004. The platform quickly expanded to [[Urcea]] in 2005.

Thinkpages became available to the entire [[Levantine Union]] on July 1, 2006. The platform added support for users to upload videos in 2009. On January 1, 2011, Thinkpages launched worldwide, launching initially with language access for 25 different languages. From its worldwide launch in 2011, Thinkpages witnessed exponential growth in its user base. Its unique origin as a military-focused blog platform lent it a sense of camaraderie and genuine connectivity that other platforms lacked. The mostly-depreciated blog feature was eventually removed in [[2013]].

===Feed===
Thinkpages central communicative area is the "feed", an area where messages of up to 240 characters (known as "thinks"), photos, or videos may be posted by a user. Thinks, photos, and videos may be directly shared by users on their feed by pressing the "rethink" button.

Beginning in the late 2010s, the short form repeatable video format became compatible on the feed.
===Profile===
User profiles on Thinkpages display all feed content generated by that user as well as photo albums, groups that user is a member of, and other related information such as location, relationship status with other users, and workplace. Users may tag other users in photographs on their profile, such as group or social setting photos.

===Groups===
Users on Thinkpages may join specific groups and make group-specific thinks that are only viewable by members of that group. Groups on Thinkpages quickly supplanted {{wp|message boards}} as the most popular way to form discussion, fan, and creative groups throughout much of the [[Occident]].
===Thinkshare===
Thinkshare is the built in messenger on the Thinkpages platform, allowing users to directly communicate with each other as well as share content and thinks posted by themselves and other users.
