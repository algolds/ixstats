# IxStats Implementation Status

**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Last Updated**: October 2025 (documentation refresh)  
**Maintainers**: IxStats engineering team

This status page reflects the current codebase after the repository-wide documentation update. All metrics below are derived from the live source tree and automation under `scripts/audit`.

## Snapshot
- Next.js 15.4.1 App Router with 65 route entries (`find src/app -name page.tsx`)
- React 19.1.0 + TypeScript 5.8.3 with granular tsconfig targets for app, components, and server packages
- tRPC 11.4 API layer: **35 routers / 546 procedures** (274 queries, 272 mutations)
- Prisma 6.12 ORM with **131 models** defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Custom server runtime (`server.mjs`) adds layered env loading and Socket.IO realtime feeds
- Frontend experience composed from >40 domain component folders under `src/components`

## Maturity Matrix
| Area | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application Shell & Navigation | ‚úÖ Ready | App Router structure across `src/app`, authenticated vs guest home flows (`src/app/page.tsx`) |
| Authentication & Session Management | ‚úÖ Ready (Clerk) / ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional Demo Mode | Clerk integration in `src/context/auth-context.tsx`, fallbacks for unauthenticated users, automation scripts in `scripts/setup` |
| MyCountry Command Suite | ‚úÖ Ready | Unified dashboard, compliance modal, intelligence tabs (`src/app/mycountry`, `src/components/mycountry`) |
| Intelligence & Diplomatic Feeds | ‚úÖ Ready | Live routers (`diplomatic-intelligence.ts`, `intelligence.ts`), UI consumption in `LiveDiplomaticFeed.tsx` |
| Economic Engine & Builder | ‚úÖ Ready | Economic calculations (`economics.ts`, `enhanced-economics.ts`), builder flows in `src/app/builder` |
| Diplomacy Systems | ‚úÖ Ready | Embassy, missions, cultural exchange data in `diplomatic.ts`, UI in `DiplomaticOperationsHub.tsx` |
| Social / ThinkPages Platform | ‚úÖ Operational | ThinkPages routes & components (`src/app/thinkpages`, `src/components/thinkshare`), comment/activity APIs |
| Achievements & Leaderboards | ‚úÖ Ready | Routers (`achievements.ts`, `leaderboards` queries), UI at `/achievements` & `/leaderboards` |
| Help & Knowledge Base | üîÑ Refreshing | Help hub is live (`src/app/help/page.tsx`); article content rebuilt in this update |
| Testing & Quality Gates | ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress | Jest configuration (`package.json`), targeted tests in `src/server/api/routers/__tests__`; expand coverage alongside feature work |
| Observability & Operations | ‚úÖ Ready | Rate limiter (`~/lib/rate-limiter`), error logger, Discord webhook support, environment-aware server boot |

## Backend Coverage
```
Routers: 35
Procedures: 546 (274 queries / 272 mutations)
Key Middleware: rateLimiter, userLoggingMiddleware, Clerk auth context
```
Core routers include `countries`, `diplomatic-intelligence`, `economics`, `intelligence`, `notifications`, `policies`, `quickactions`, `sdi`, `unified-intelligence`, and `wikiCache`. Refer to `docs/reference/api.md` for the generated index.

## Data Model Status
- `prisma/schema.prisma` defines economic, diplomatic, social, notification, and intelligence domains
- SQLite databases for dev/prod live under `prisma/`
- Seed, backup, and restore scripts in `scripts/setup`
- Migrations are linear and applied via `npm run db:migrate`

## Frontend Coverage
- Executive dashboards leverage shared UI kits in `src/components/ui`
- MyCountry views compose analytics components (`IntelligenceTabSystem.tsx`, `NationalPerformanceCommandCenter.tsx`)
- ThinkPages and ThinkShare share feed widgets (`src/components/thinkpages`, `src/components/thinkshare`)
- In-app help and onboarding content renders from `/help/*` routes using shared layouts (`src/app/help/_components/ArticleLayout.tsx`)

## Testing & Tooling
- Jest environment configured in `package.json`
- Targeted router tests (e.g., `diplomaticIntelligence.test.ts`)
- Automation scripts under `scripts/audit` for wiring verification, CRUD checks, and economic calculations
- Playwright configuration in `playwright.config.ts` prepared for end-to-end coverage (tests pending)

## Known Follow-Ups
1. Expand automated test suites for new help content and additional routers
2. Reconcile dev/prod environment variable sets (`docs/operations/environments.md` tracks the authoritative list)
3. Continue migrating legacy documentation into the refreshed structure and deprecate unused guides
4. Monitor WebSocket behaviour in development once the server toggle is re-enabled for local runs

This document should be updated whenever major features ship, new routers/models land, or operational tooling changes.
